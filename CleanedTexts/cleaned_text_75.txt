 Feb 28, 2025 Mechanical Engineering, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php The Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering program is designed to meet the academic and professional needs of both recent mechanical engineering graduates and practicing engineers. This program aims to enhance skills in contemporary analytical, experimental, and computational methods, all within the scope of engineering design and integrated with an industrial perspective. Students begin the program with a graduate-level Advanced Mathematics course (3 credits), preparing them to tackle complex engineering problems. The program also offers courses in Heat Transfer, Solid Mechanics, Advanced Manufacturing, and Fluid Mechanics, equipping students with essential knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the program enables students to gain practical skills and develop research methodologies necessary for major project or thesis requirements. To earn the Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, candidates must successfully complete at least 30 credits. The program's structural flexibility allows candidates to use 24 credits for specialization in their chosen areas, customizing their educational journey to suit their career aspirations and goals. Decisions regarding core and elective courses require the final approval of the program coordinator. Through its blend of innovative and rigorous academic frameworks, the program strives to develop well-rounded, competent, and industry-aligned professionals who can make significant contributions to their fields. Program Outcomes Students completing the program will be able to: Apply advanced mathematical analysis and finite element methods to solve complex mechanical engineering problems. Solve intricate engineering problems in domains such as automation, manufacturing, energy management, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and dynamic systems. Effectively articulate complex ideas and solutions through oral presentations and written reports, ensuring understanding among diverse audiences. Evaluate the impact of an industrial perspective on selected mechanical engineering applications. Design solutions for emerging mechanical engineering problems. Admission Policy Applicants holding a bachelor's degree in a field closely related to mechanical engineering, such as aerospace engineering or industrial engineering, may receive consideration for provisional admission. Students accepted provisionally may need to complete additional undergraduate mechanical engineering courses and/or graduate courses. MS Thesis Option Students interested in pursuing the MS Thesis option should first find an advisor. Then, with approval from the Coordinator, Department Chair, and College Dean, they should complete two courses: MECH 6698 Thesis I and MECH 6699 Thesis II. Required Courses (6 credits)MECH 6602 - Mechanical Engineering AnalysisMECH 6680 - Mechanical Engineering SeminarNote: MECH 6680 must be taken three times for a total of 3 creditsElectives (21 credits)Select 21 credits from the following:MECH 6604 - Numerical Techniques in Mechanical EngineeringMECH 6605 - Finite Element Methods in EngineeringMECH 6606 - Fundamentals of CombustionMECH 6610 - Advanced DynamicsMECH 6611 - System VibrationsMECH 6613 - Fundamentals of AcousticsMECH 6615 - ElasticityMECH 6620 - Classical ThermodynamicsMECH 6622 - Topics in Thermodynamics and Fluid MechanicsMECH 6625 - Mechanics of ContinuaMECH 6627 - Computer-Aided EngineeringMECH 6630 - Advanced Fluid MechanicsMECH 6631 - Topics in General Heat TransferMECH 6632 - Applied Conduction Heat TransferMECH 6633 - Convection Heat TransferMECH 6635 - Dynamic Systems and ControlMECH 6636 - Fundamentals of MechatronicsMECH 6638 - Measurement and Instrumentation in Mechanical EngineeringMECH 6645 - Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat TransferMECH 6647 - Two-Phase FlowMECH 6651 - Microscale Energy TransferMECH 6655 - Interfacing Mechanical DevicesMECH 6690 - Research ProjectMECH 6695 - Independent Study IMECH 6696 - Independent Study IIMECH 6698 - Thesis IMECH 6699 - Thesis IIMECH 6670 - Special TopicsSpecial Topics include: Energy and Energy Efficiency, Automation/Manufacturing, Mechatronics, Robotics, and any other modern topics relevant to the Mechanical Engineering program identified by the department. Students can take one non-MECH course with the approval of Graduate Coordinator which meets towards the elective requirement.Major Project Requirement (3 credits)All students must satisfy the major project/thesis requirement by completing a substantial project. There are three different options to satisfy this requirement: Thesis Option (6 credits) - completion of both Thesis I and Thesis II will meet the major project requirement (3 credits) and one elective course (3 credits). MECH 6698 Thesis I and MECH 6699 Thesis II Research Project Option (3 credits) MECH 6690 Research Project Course Project Option (3 credits) Students may undertake a project related to Mechanical Engineering through any of the MECH courses listed below within the department. The project must be of high quality, reflecting the program's stringent standards. Any one course from the below list: MECH 6605 - Finite Element Methods in Engineering MECH 6610 - Advanced Dynamics MECH 6627 - Computer-Aided Engineering MECH 6630 - Advanced Fluid Mechanics MECH 6632 - Applied Conduction Heat Transfer MECH 6645 - Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer MECH 6690 - Research Project MECH 6695 - Independent Study I or MECH 6698 - Thesis I and MECH 6699 - Thesis IIFocus Areas (optional)Focus areas are optional clusters of courses that provide depth in an area related to mechanical engineering. Those courses typically consist of electives that are enrolled in depending on the focus area.Focus Area 1: Energy and Thermo-Fluids:MECH 6606 - Fundamentals of CombustionMECH 6630 - Advanced Fluid MechanicsMECH 6632 - Applied Conduction Heat TransferMECH 6645 - Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer Focus Area 2: Manufacturing and Automation:MECH 6635 - Dynamic Systems and ControlMECH 6670 - Special Topics -- Special Topics in Automation/Manufacturing -- Special Topics in Mechatronics -- Special Topics in Robotics Focus Area 3: Design and Analysis:MECH 6602 - Mechanical Engineering AnalysisMECH 6604 - Numerical Techniques in Mechanical EngineeringMECH 6605 - Finite Element Methods in EngineeringMECH 6627 - Computer-Aided EngineeringMECH 6645 - Computational Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer Catalog Search Choose Search Location Select an option Courses Programs Hierarchy Items Other Content Entire Catalog Whole Word/Phrase Advanced Search Catalog Home The University Graduate Programs Academic Policies Policies & Procedures for Ph.D. Degree Academic and Student Services College of Arts and Sciences Pompea College of Business Tagliatela College of Engineering Henry C.
