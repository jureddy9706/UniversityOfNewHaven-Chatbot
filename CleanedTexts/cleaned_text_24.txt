There are three different ways that a student can satisfy the project requirement: CHEM 6685 Graduate Research Project (restricted elective). Students must find an advisor, prepare a project proposal and obtain written approval for the project prior to registration. This option offers an advantage to students who may choose to explore areas outside the curriculum. CHEM 6698 Thesis I and CHEM 6699 Thesis II (restricted electives). Students who plan to do a thesis should find a thesis advisor in their first or second semester, prepare a thesis proposal, and obtain written approval for the thesis prior to registration. For this option, both CHEM 6698 and CHEM 6699 must be completed. CHEM 6688 Graduate Internship (restricted elective). Students must find a company or research-related organization that will host students to conduct an internship activity related to chemistry research, such as computational modeling, chemical synthesis, chemical characterization, or chemical processing. An evaluation of the internship performance will be provided by the internship supervisor.
