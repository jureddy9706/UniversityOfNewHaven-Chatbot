 Feb 28, 2025 Civil Engineering, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php The master of science in civil engineering is designed for individuals with a keen interest in civil infrastructure, construction management/engineering, or sustainability wanting to develop expertise in the analysis and design of multidisciplinary civil engineering projects, usually in a team-oriented professional environment. The program is uniquely multidisciplinary, combining knowledge of a variety of engineering disciplines to address the current needs of society. A minimum of 30 credits must be completed to earn the master of science degree in civil engineering. Specialized focus areas include: sustainability & construction engineering, and infrastructure engineering. Program Outcomes Perform detailed design of civil engineering systems Propose viable solutions to civil engineering problem Review research in civil engineering or related fields Communicate advanced technical knowledge pertaining to civil engineering through both oral and written means Before enrolling, students are generally required to have completed undergraduate courses in Physics I and lab, General Chemistry I and lab, Calculus I, II, and III. Applicants with strong academic or professional experience but without the necessary background for enrolling in some of the required courses may be asked to complete additional courses and will be notified at the time of admission.
