 Feb 28, 2025 Cellular and Molecular Biology, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php Program Outcomes 1. Students will exhibit mastery of advanced cell and molecular biology content 2. Students will be able to critically analyze primary literature from cell and molecular biology journals 3. Students will employ appropriate experimental design and formulate testable hypothesis 4. Students will effectively communicate scientific principles and data verbally or in writing 5. Students will be able to utilize basic and advanced laboratory techniques, computational tools and equipment. A minimum of 38 to 39 credit hours of graduate work must be completed to earn the Master of Science degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology. Candidates for the program must have a background in biology, chemistry or a related field with specific course work that includes genetics or molecular biology, general and organic chemistry and biochemistry. Students choosing a non-thesis option are required to take a minimum of 12 credit hours of laboratory course work in addition to a written comprehensive exam. The purpose of the comprehensive examination is to assess the candidate's understanding of their course work and to evaluate the ability of the candidate to synthesize research and theory in the field of cellular and molecular biology and to present this information in an effective written format. After a minimum of 18 credits of graduate course work, non-thesis students with a minimum GPA of 3.0 may elect 3 credit hours of research, consisting of CMBI 6690 - Research Project, or CMBI 6688 - Internship I, upon the approval of the program coordinator.
