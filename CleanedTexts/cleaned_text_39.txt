 Feb 28, 2025 Data Science, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php The Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program is designed to prepare students for opportunities and challenges in the field of data science. The program offers a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistical modeling. Specialized focus areas include big data, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing with opportunities to gain subject matter expertise in a wide range of cross-disciplinary fields such as security, business analytics, and health care analytics. To earn the MSDS degree, a student must complete a minimum of 33 credits. One of these courses (3 credits) is considered a prerequisite preparatory course, which may be waived by the program coordinator during the initial admission application review. Students will be informed if the course is waived or required at the time of admission. Program Outcomes: Perform explorative data analysis in the context of real world applications. Design and build appropriate algorithms to model and interpret data. Build an end-to-end distributed data-pipeline. Apply subject-matter expertise to the design and development of data-driven solutions. Demonstrate the ability to work independently.
