Students identify a field of research at the time of admission that aligns with their career goals, previous educational experience, and existing faculty expertise. Disciplines represented include biomedical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, electrical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechanical engineering. Specific specializations will necessarily depend on faculty research interests which, based upon current active research groups, may include such fields as biomaterials for medical devices, tissue engineering, rapid detection of microbes, cybersecurity and forensics, artificial intelligence, data science, nondestructive evaluation, radar signal processing, renewable energy systems, wireless communication and advanced antennas, structural engineering, sustainability in engineering, and environmental remediation. Coursework is likewise tailored to a student's research interest and prior academic background. Students entering directly into the Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree will take at minimum 36 credits of coursework (12 courses: 3 Common, 9 Technical Core), of which 27 credits must be completed before taking the qualifying exam (3 semesters full-time). Students wanting a master's degree en passat must take an additional 15 credits of coursework (5 courses). All Ph.D. students shall be required to take three 3-credit, 7000-level Common Courses covering research methods and ethics, grant writing and management, and focused technical knowledge at a post-master's level. Students will also take nine 3-credit graduate-level Technical Core courses following an individualized program of study which is developed prior to admission and generally follows existing master's degree worksheets of various programs within the College of Engineering. Students will take the qualifying exam after their first (students entering with master's degrees) or third (students entering with bachelor's degrees) semester. These exams will be offered twice a year, before the start of the fall and spring semesters. The format of this exam will be decided by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D.",
