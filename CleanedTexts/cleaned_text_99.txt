 Feb 28, 2025 Bioinformatics Certificate Advisor: Eva Sapi, Professor, Ph.D., Eotvos Lorand University This certificate program provides a practical, "hands-on" approach to computer applications in molecular biology and focuses on the major issues concerning representation and analysis of biological sequence and structural information. With a strong foundation in computer science and molecular biology, students will acquire a background in generating, analyzing, and interpreting biological data, as well as the ability to apply such knowledge in biotechnology and medicine. The curriculum is designed to accommodate two convergent audiences: 1) molecular biology students with limited experience in computer systems who wish to upgrade their skills and knowledge in the field of bioinformatics, and 2) computer science students with computational or mathematical skills who wish to learn how to apply those skills to real biological problems. The curriculum for this certificate includes five courses (15 credits), which combine computer science, molecular genetics, and bioinformatics. Prerequisites for the certificate include undergraduate molecular biology or biochemistry and college algebra.
