 Feb 28, 2025 Fire Protection Engineering, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php. The master of science in Fire Protection Engineering prepares students to lead projects that require knowledge and skills of practicing fire protection engineering. The program will equip students with the ability to design, analyze, and model fire protection systems and risk analysis for future rapidly-changing safety requirements in various fast-growing situations, such as manufacturing, labs, smart buildings, energy storage facilities, etc. A high job market demand shows a large student recruitment potential for students with B.S. engineering background in other engineering disciplines and a desire to pursue opportunities in fire protection engineering. This program requires the completion of 30 credit hours. Program Outcomes: 1. Conduct appropriate experimentation or computer simulation in a fire phenomena and protection system. 2. Solve real-world fire protection engineering problems within budgetary and time constraints. 3. Create a code-based justification for their solution(s) based on findings to the authority having jurisdiction. 4. Solve defined fire protection systems problems using mathematics, science, and engineering tools. 5. Communicate technical contents of fire engineering project design and implementation.
