Analyze complex problems and research questions related to crime and the administration of justice. Create and deliver oral and written communications that evaluate complex problems in crime and the administration of justice. Admissions All Ph.D. Programs must adhere to core admissions requirements. Programs of the various colleges may augment the core requirements with additional ones as appropriate. However, the minimum (core) requirements may not be waived or substituted under any circumstances. The core qualifications and admission requirements shall be as follows: Given the specification of the program requirement below, applicants must possess a minimum of a Master's degree from an accredited college or university recognized and approved by the university. However, programs may admit students with Bachelor's degrees into their own Master's program with a plan of studies for transition to the Ph.D. upon successful completion of the Masters. One official transcript from each institution attended must accompany the application. These documents are to be submitted by the issuing academic institution(s) directly to the university. If the applicant's most recent degree was awarded more than ten years prior to the initial academic term of enrollment in the Ph.D. program, the candidate must demonstrate currency in the field to the satisfaction of the program administrator. Applicants must provide official reports of scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or other equivalent standardized examinations acceptable to the program, which have been taken no more than two years prior to the date of application to the university. These are to be submitted by the testing authority directly to the university. Applicants must furnish three confidential letters of recommendation. Two of the letters are to be from persons familiar with the candidate's scholarly abilities. The letters are to address specifically the applicant's (a) ability to conduct research in the proposed field of study, (b) writing ability, and (c) integrity. These letters are to be submitted directly to the university. Applicants must submit an essay of no more than 1,500 words describing the area of interest that the applicant proposes to pursue and the motivation for pursuing the degree. Applicants must submit an additional writing sample of previous academic, professional, or published work. Applicants must furnish a detailed resume or a curriculum vita. In the case of an applicant whose first language is not English, that applicant must furnish documented evidence of their ability to communicate (write, read, and speak), in English. All applicants to the university whose native language is not English must present satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the IELTS. Minimum TOEFL scores for admission to the Ph.D. program are 250 on the computer-generated score, 100 on the Internet-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test, or the IELTS equivalent. That test must have been taken within the two years immediately preceding the requested trimester of admission. In extraordinary circumstances, applicants who do not meet the above TOEFL scores may be admitted, but only with approval from the Dean of the College and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Applicants who have completed requirements for a bachelor's or a master's degree from an accredited U.S. university are not required to submit a TOEFL score. When a TOEFL score is a requirement for admission, individual graduate departments may require a TOEFL score higher than the threshold scores previously listed. Application Deadlines Candidates are strongly encouraged to submit their application documentation as early as possible. This is important because financial aid/assistantship/fellowship requests may have deadlines that do not mirror matriculation deadlines. Students may seek admission to begin enrollment during any term except where individual programs have restricted start terms. A letter of intent and the application may be submitted at any time for a specified future academic year. But, unless specified earlier by the particular program, the Office of Graduate Admissions must receive all of the documentation required by the College Program for which the applicant has applied no later than one and one-half months prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin (July 15th for fall matriculation). The applicant will be notified by the university of its decision to admit or not no later than one month prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin. Program Residency (Credit) Requirements A minimum of forty-two credit hours beyond the master's degree are required for the Ph.D. degree apportioned as follows: A minimum of 30 credit hours of course work corresponding to 10 or more courses is required. A minimum of three credit hours of research culminating in a prospectus for the dissertation is required. Candidates who do not complete their prospectus within the prescribed time will register for an additional three credit hours of prospectus research giving them additional time to complete the work. A minimum of 9 credit hours of dissertation research is required. Candidates will register for 3 credit hours of dissertation research per term while conducting the dissertation research. During these three academic terms, each 3-credit enrollment will be considered equivalent to full-time status. Candidates must register on a Continuing Registration basis upon completion of the 42 credit-hour requirements if they have not completed their dissertation. The minimum of 42 credit hours beyond the Master's degree presupposes that the applicant's Master's degree has been approved by the academic unit managing the Ph.D. as being sufficiently preparatory to that program. Full-time or part-time study may be pursued, subject to all time and qualitative requirements for the degree being satisfied. However, regardless of the mode of study, a candidate is required to devote at least three consecutive terms, or the equivalent, of full-time study for the dissertation research in residence at the main campus (or at a location appropriate to the dissertation research as approved by the dissertation committee and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies.) Time Limits It is expected that full-time students complete the 42 credit hours of course work, prospectus research, and dissertation research and writing within four calendar years. Students who have completed the 42 credit requirement without having actually completed the dissertation must register on a Continuing Registration basis. The maximum time allowed to earn the Ph.D. with the applicant having the Master's as a base is six years from the time one enrolls in the doctoral program. Under extraordinary circumstances and upon approval of the dissertation committee, and the Dean of the College, and the Provost's designee, an extension may be granted to complete the dissertation research, its defense and submittal. Registration/Enrollment Requirements/Advisement Incoming doctoral students will work closely with the departmental coordinator of the program, or designee, to select appropriate courses and to plan for qualifying examinations. This coordinator will serve as the adviser of record until the student completes the required course work. At intervals determined by each program, a faculty committee chaired by the program coordinator will evaluate each student’s progress in the program, using criteria developed by the program. These written evaluations will be shared with the student. Doctoral students are encouraged to establish relationships with other faculty within the program during the first terms of study, and soon after passing the qualifying examinations, doctoral students should identify a primary dissertation adviser. This adviser will be designated the chair of the student’s doctoral dissertation committee. This committee will consist of three members or more, members and will be formed through consultation among the student, the adviser, and the coordinator of the graduate program and/or departmental chair. Doctoral dissertation committees must include at least two members of the department hosting the doctoral degree; at least one member from outside the home department, and, where appropriate, a member from outside the University. Grades and Satisfactory Progress Valid grades are those from the existing graduate set, A through F (including +/-), P/F for the dissertation credits, W, INC. Satisfactory Progress is defined as a cumulative QPR of 3.0 or greater. A student who falls below 3.0 (cumulative) would not be allowed to register without permission from the academic adviser. The adviser may permit a student not making satisfactory progress to register, but only with written conditions being set. If the conditions are not subsequently met, the student would not be permitted to continue in the program. Leave of Absence A leave of absence (LOA) from the Ph.D. program is an interruption in the formal program of study for extenuating circumstances and may only be taken with approval of Associate Provost for Graduate Studies, considering the academic department's recommendation. A LOA may be for personal, medical, professional, or parental reasons and may be granted for up to one year at a time. If more than one year is needed, another application would be required. A student must notify the registrar in writing of the intent to end the LOA and resume registering. Students may complete INC grades during a LOA, but no other formal program progress may be made during that time. The duration of an approved LOA will not be counted toward the time limits set to complete the Ph.D. program or its component phases. A LOA cannot be back-dated. A student not registered without an approved LOA will be presumed to have withdrawn from the program and will be notified in writing to that effect. Withdrawal and Re-admission Discipline and/or dismissal for non-academic causes follows existing university procedures and practices. Dismissal for academic cause follows the existing graduate policy and procedures. A student who voluntarily withdraws from a Ph.D. program or withdraws by virtue of non-registration may subsequently re-apply for admission. Such applications are judged by the admissions standards in force at the time of the subsequent application. If the student is re-admitted, they are subject to the program requirements in force at the time of re-admission. Previous credit earned will be evaluated in that light. Transfer Credit/Advance Standing A maximum of six credits may be transferred from other institutions with similar doctoral or relevant Master’s programs upon approval of the Dean and program coordinator. Foreign Language Requirements There is no University-wide language requirement for the doctoral degree. Please consult the requirements for individual programs to see whether a foreign language may be required for a particular program. Qualifying Examinations The student is required to complete qualifying examinations in order to be admitted for candidacy for the dissertation. The program faculty is responsible for determination of the qualifying examination process and procedure as well as the exams themselves. The promulgated process and procedure must include a statement that addresses whether re-taking failed examinations are permitted and, if so, in what ways. The detailed schedule of requirements will be set and published by the specific program. Phases of Study – Candidacy for the Ph.D., Admission to Candidacy, Prospectus for the Dissertation—Acceptance Successful completion of qualifying exams are required for admission to candidacy for the dissertation . Candidacy for the Ph.D. is formalized and recorded upon academic acceptance of the dissertation prospectus by the academic department. The latter is a pre-requisite for registration for any of the nine credits of required dissertation research. The dissertation must be successfully defended and approved and properly submitted for the Ph.D. degree to be granted. Program Oversight The responsibility for the college-wide oversight of the doctoral program rests with the Dean of the College where the program resides. The Dean may appoint a Director of the Doctoral Program if the volume of activity warrants it. The Dean’s Office or Director will work closely with assigned faculty advisors to facilitate and monitor student progress throughout the various phases of the program. The Associate Provost for Graduate Studies has university-wide oversight of all doctoral programs to ensure that institutional standards are met and procedures are followed. Dissertation Format Dissertation and Thesis Manual . Dissertation Defense, Completion Upon recommendation of the student’s dissertation committee, the doctoral candidate will arrange a date for the dissertation defense. The defense should be scheduled prior to November 1 to allow for a Winter graduation or April 15 for the Spring commencement. At the defense, the Committee may request that additional corrections be made to the Dissertation, and will specify a timeline for the completion of these revisions. Final acceptance of the dissertation is contingent on approval by the dissertation committee, the Dean of the College, and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Financial Requirements/Financial Support Please refer to the graduate catalog for a schedule of tuition, doctoral program fee charges, and tuition assistance. A limited amount of tuition assistance based on need may be available. Support for tuition in the form of fellowship stipends, teaching fellowships, or research assistantships may be available from the specific college. Personal Conduct/Ethics Students in the doctoral program must strictly adhere to all elements of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, which addresses issues of research misconduct as well as plagiarism. Sponsored, Classified, Proprietary Research Dissertation research proposals that involve national security classification implications or commercial undertakings related to the student’s employment interpreted as proprietary by that private-sector enterprise will be evaluated for acceptability as valid dissertation subject on a case-by-case basis. Intellectual Property The student’s Intellectual Property rights are governed by the University’s guidelines as set forth in the .

Applicants must provide official reports of scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or other equivalent standardized examinations acceptable to the program, which have been taken no more than two years prior to the date of application to the university. These are to be submitted by the testing authority directly to the university. Applicants must furnish three confidential letters of recommendation. Two of the letters are to be from persons familiar with the candidate's scholarly abilities. The letters are to address specifically the applicant's (a) ability to conduct research in the proposed field of study, (b) writing ability, and (c) integrity. These letters are to be submitted directly to the university. Applicants must submit an essay of no more than 1,500 words describing the area of interest that the applicant proposes to pursue and the motivation for pursuing the degree. Applicants must submit an additional writing sample of previous academic, professional, or published work. Applicants must furnish a detailed resume or a curriculum vita. In the case of an applicant whose first language is not English, that applicant must furnish documented evidence of their ability to communicate (write, read, and speak), in English. All applicants to the university whose native language is not English must present satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the IELTS. Minimum TOEFL scores for admission to the Ph.D. program are 250 on the computer-generated score, 100 on the Internet-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test, or the IELTS equivalent. That test must have been taken within the two years immediately preceding the requested trimester of admission. In extraordinary circumstances, applicants who do not meet the above TOEFL scores may be admitted, but only with approval from the Dean of the College and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Applicants who have completed requirements for a bachelor's or a master's degree from an accredited U.S. university are not required to submit a TOEFL score. When a TOEFL score is a requirement for admission, individual graduate departments may require a TOEFL score higher than the threshold scores previously listed. Application Deadlines Candidates are strongly encouraged to submit their application documentation as early as possible. This is important because financial aid/assistantship/fellowship requests may have deadlines that do not mirror matriculation deadlines. Students may seek admission to begin enrollment during any term except where individual programs have restricted start terms. A letter of intent and the application may be submitted at any time for a specified future academic year. But, unless specified earlier by the particular program, the Office of Graduate Admissions must receive all of the documentation required by the College Program for which the applicant has applied no later than one and one-half months prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin (July 15th for fall matriculation). The applicant will be notified by the university of its decision to admit or not no later than one month prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin. Program Residency (Credit) Requirements A minimum of forty-two credit hours beyond the master's degree are required for the Ph.D. degree apportioned as follows: A minimum of 30 credit hours of course work corresponding to 10 or more courses is required. A minimum of three credit hours of research culminating in a prospectus for the dissertation is required. Candidates who do not complete their prospectus within the prescribed time will register for an additional three credit hours of prospectus research giving them additional time to complete the work. A minimum of 9 credit hours of dissertation research is required. Candidates will register for 3 credit hours of dissertation research per term while conducting the dissertation research. During these three academic terms, each 3-credit enrollment will be considered equivalent to full-time status. Candidates must register on a Continuing Registration basis upon completion of the 42 credit-hour requirements if they have not completed their dissertation. The minimum of 42 credit hours beyond the Master's degree presupposes that the applicant's Master's degree has been approved by the academic unit managing the Ph.D. as being sufficiently preparatory to that program. Full-time or part-time study may be pursued, subject to all time and qualitative requirements for the degree being satisfied. However, regardless of the mode of study, a candidate is required to devote at least three consecutive terms, or the equivalent, of full-time study for the dissertation research in residence at the main campus (or at a location appropriate to the dissertation research as approved by the dissertation committee and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies.) Time Limits It is expected that full-time students complete the 42 credit hours of course work, prospectus research, and dissertation research and writing within four calendar years. Students who have completed the 42 credit requirement without having actually completed the dissertation must register on a Continuing Registration basis. The maximum time allowed to earn the Ph.D. with the applicant having the Master's as a base is six years from the time one enrolls in the doctoral program. Under extraordinary circumstances and upon approval of the dissertation committee, and the Dean of the College, and the Provost's designee, an extension may be granted to complete the dissertation research, its defense and submittal. Registration/Enrollment Requirements/Advisement Incoming doctoral students will work closely with the departmental coordinator of the program, or designee, to select appropriate courses and to plan for qualifying examinations. This coordinator will serve as the adviser of record until the student completes the required course work. At intervals determined by each program, a faculty committee chaired by the program coordinator will evaluate each student’s progress in the program, using criteria developed by the program. These written evaluations will be shared with the student. Doctoral students are encouraged to establish relationships with other faculty within the program during the first terms of study, and soon after passing the qualifying examinations, doctoral students should identify a primary dissertation adviser. This adviser will be designated the chair of the student’s doctoral dissertation committee. This committee will consist of three members or more, members and will be formed through consultation among the student, the adviser, and the coordinator of the graduate program and/or departmental chair. Doctoral dissertation committees must include at least two members of the department hosting the doctoral degree; at least one member from outside the home department, and, where appropriate, a member from outside the University. Grades and Satisfactory Progress Valid grades are those from the existing graduate set, A through F (including +/-), P/F for the dissertation credits, W, INC. Satisfactory Progress is defined as a cumulative QPR of 3.0 or greater. A student who falls below 3.0 (cumulative) would not be allowed to register without permission from the academic adviser. The adviser may permit a student not making satisfactory progress to register, but only with written conditions being set. If the conditions are not subsequently met, the student would not be permitted to continue in the program. Leave of Absence A leave of absence (LOA) from the Ph.D. program is an interruption in the formal program of study for extenuating circumstances and may only be taken with approval of Associate Provost for Graduate Studies, considering the academic department's recommendation. A LOA may be for personal, medical, professional, or parental reasons and may be granted for up to one year at a time. If more than one year is needed, another application would be required. A student must notify the registrar in writing of the intent to end the LOA and resume registering. Students may complete INC grades during a LOA, but no other formal program progress may be made during that time. The duration of an approved LOA will not be counted toward the time limits set to complete the Ph.D. program or its component phases. A LOA cannot be back-dated. A student not registered without an approved LOA will be presumed to have withdrawn from the program and will be notified in writing to that effect. Withdrawal and Re-admission Discipline and/or dismissal for non-academic causes follows existing university procedures and practices. Dismissal for academic cause follows the existing graduate policy and procedures. A student who voluntarily withdraws from a Ph.D. program or withdraws by virtue of non-registration may subsequently re-apply for admission. Such applications are judged by the admissions standards in force at the time of the subsequent application. If the student is re-admitted, they are subject to the program requirements in force at the time of re-admission. Previous credit earned will be evaluated in that light. Transfer Credit/Advance Standing A maximum of six credits may be transferred from other institutions with similar doctoral or relevant Master’s programs upon approval of the Dean and program coordinator. Foreign Language Requirements There is no University-wide language requirement for the doctoral degree. Please consult the requirements for individual programs to see whether a foreign language may be required for a particular program. Qualifying Examinations The student is required to complete qualifying examinations in order to be admitted for candidacy for the dissertation. The program faculty is responsible for determination of the qualifying examination process and procedure as well as the exams themselves. The promulgated process and procedure must include a statement that addresses whether re-taking failed examinations are permitted and, if so, in what ways. The detailed schedule of requirements will be set and published by the specific program. Phases of Study – Candidacy for the Ph.D., Admission to Candidacy, Prospectus for the Dissertation—Acceptance Successful completion of qualifying exams are required for admission to candidacy for the dissertation . Candidacy for the Ph.D. is formalized and recorded upon academic acceptance of the dissertation prospectus by the academic department. The latter is a pre-requisite for registration for any of the nine credits of required dissertation research. The dissertation must be successfully defended and approved and properly submitted for the Ph.D. degree to be granted. Program Oversight The responsibility for the college-wide oversight of the doctoral program rests with the Dean of the College where the program resides. The Dean may appoint a Director of the Doctoral Program if the volume of activity warrants it. The Dean’s Office or Director will work closely with assigned faculty advisors to facilitate and monitor student progress throughout the various phases of the program. The Associate Provost for Graduate Studies has university-wide oversight of all doctoral programs to ensure that institutional standards are met and procedures are followed. Dissertation Format Dissertation and Thesis Manual . Dissertation Defense, Completion Upon recommendation of the student’s dissertation committee, the doctoral candidate will arrange a date for the dissertation defense. The defense should be scheduled prior to November 1 to allow for a Winter graduation or April 15 for the Spring commencement. At the defense, the Committee may request that additional corrections be made to the Dissertation, and will specify a timeline for the completion of these revisions. Final acceptance of the dissertation is contingent on approval by the dissertation committee, the Dean of the College, and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Financial Requirements/Financial Support Please refer to the graduate catalog for a schedule of tuition, doctoral program fee charges, and tuition assistance. A limited amount of tuition assistance based on need may be available. Support for tuition in the form of fellowship stipends, teaching fellowships, or research assistantships may be available from the specific college. Personal Conduct/Ethics Students in the doctoral program must strictly adhere to all elements of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, which addresses issues of research misconduct as well as plagiarism. Sponsored, Classified, Proprietary Research Dissertation research proposals that involve national security classification implications or commercial undertakings related to the student’s employment interpreted as proprietary by that private-sector enterprise will be evaluated for acceptability as valid dissertation subject on a case-by-case basis.

Students identify a field of research at the time of admission that aligns with their career goals, previous educational experience, and existing faculty expertise. Disciplines represented include biomedical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, electrical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechanical engineering. Specific specializations will necessarily depend on faculty research interests which, based upon current active research groups, may include such fields as biomaterials for medical devices, tissue engineering, rapid detection of microbes, cybersecurity and forensics, artificial intelligence, data science, nondestructive evaluation, radar signal processing, renewable energy systems, wireless communication and advanced antennas, structural engineering, sustainability in engineering, and environmental remediation. Coursework is likewise tailored to a student's research interest and prior academic background. Students entering directly into the Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree will take at minimum 36 credits of coursework (12 courses: 3 Common, 9 Technical Core), of which 27 credits must be completed before taking the qualifying exam (3 semesters full-time). Students wanting a master's degree en passat must take an additional 15 credits of coursework (5 courses). All Ph.D. students shall be required to take three 3-credit, 7000-level Common Courses covering research methods and ethics, grant writing and management, and focused technical knowledge at a post-master's level. Students will also take nine 3-credit graduate-level Technical Core courses following an individualized program of study which is developed prior to admission and generally follows existing master's degree worksheets of various programs within the College of Engineering. Students will take the qualifying exam after their first (students entering with master's degrees) or third (students entering with bachelor's degrees) semester. These exams will be offered twice a year, before the start of the fall and spring semesters. The format of this exam will be decided by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee (containing members from each program represented in the Ph.D. program appointed by the Dean and chaired by the Ph.D. program coordinator) with input from the students' programs. Students will have at most two attempts. Students not passing the qualifying exam are dismissed from the Ph.D. program but should have completed the requirements for a master's degree. Students successfully passing the qualifying exam become Ph.D. candidates and are enrolled in Dissertation Research (3 credits each semester, counts as full-time enrollment). Students must complete a minimum of 15 credits of Dissertation Research (5 semesters). The final required component for graduation is the successful oral defense of a written dissertation of the student's original research. This will be adjudicated by a committee containing no fewer than four members, all of whom, including the major advisor, must hold a doctoral degree. The dissertation committee will include the primary research advisor (acting as chair), at least two University faculty members who have expertise in the field, and at least one additional member who is either external to the University or external to the College of Engineering. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. program, students will have individualized programs of study for the required coursework. Each applicant is required to find a primary advisor prior to admission. This advisor is the primary academic contact for the student and is responsible for creating an individualized plan of study. In general, this will be the primary research advisor for the student as well, although the student may change advisor under special circumstances. This advisor is expected to evaluate each student's progress in the program at least once per academic year, with written evaluations shared with the student. Admissions decisions are made by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee with the addition of the student's primary advisor. Students wishing to change advisors after matriculation will be required to meet with the current advisor, proposed advisor, and Ph.D. program coordinator, who will together make a decision in the best interests of the student. Standards for admission are as follows: • Successful completion of an MS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5; or successful completion of a BS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5 • A strong statement of research aligned with the research expertise of one or more STEM-focused faculty at the University • Willingness of a STEM-focused faculty member in the University to supervise the candidate upon successful completion of the qualifying examination Goals of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program include: 1. Preparing exceptional students for careers at academic institutions and industry 2. Offering students the knowledge and experiences required to respond to 21st century challenges across a broad field of specialties 3. Training students to conduct research and disseminate results in an ethical and professional manner 4. Providing a curriculum that develops critical and analytical thinking skills through an integrative approach of instruction, research, and evidence-based practices Upon completion of the Ph.D. in Engineering and Applied Science program, graduates will be able to: 1. Apply critical thinking skills in foundational areas of engineering and applied science. 2. Detail the current state of knowledge in an engineering or applied science specialty and apply it to solve modern problems. 3. Integrate knowledge and skills to design, conduct, analyze, and publish original research findings. 4. Illustrate effective skills in technical written and oral communication.

Students identify a field of research at the time of admission that aligns with their career goals, previous educational experience, and existing faculty expertise. Disciplines represented include biomedical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, electrical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechanical engineering. Specific specializations will necessarily depend on faculty research interests which, based upon current active research groups, may include such fields as biomaterials for medical devices, tissue engineering, rapid detection of microbes, cybersecurity and forensics, artificial intelligence, data science, nondestructive evaluation, radar signal processing, renewable energy systems, wireless communication and advanced antennas, structural engineering, sustainability in engineering, and environmental remediation. Coursework is likewise tailored to a student's research interest and prior academic background. Students entering directly into the Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree will take at minimum 36 credits of coursework (12 courses: 3 Common, 9 Technical Core), of which 27 credits must be completed before taking the qualifying exam (3 semesters full-time). Students wanting a master's degree en passat must take an additional 15 credits of coursework (5 courses). All Ph.D. students shall be required to take three 3-credit, 7000-level Common Courses covering research methods and ethics, grant writing and management, and focused technical knowledge at a post-master's level. Students will also take nine 3-credit graduate-level Technical Core courses following an individualized program of study which is developed prior to admission and generally follows existing master's degree worksheets of various programs within the College of Engineering. Students will take the qualifying exam after their first (students entering with master's degrees) or third (students entering with bachelor's degrees) semester. These exams will be offered twice a year, before the start of the fall and spring semesters. The format of this exam will be decided by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee (containing members from each program represented in the Ph.D. program appointed by the Dean and chaired by the Ph.D. program coordinator) with input from the students' programs. Students will have at most two attempts. Students not passing the qualifying exam are dismissed from the Ph.D. program but should have completed the requirements for a master's degree. Students successfully passing the qualifying exam become Ph.D. candidates and are enrolled in Dissertation Research (3 credits each semester, counts as full-time enrollment). Students must complete a minimum of 15 credits of Dissertation Research (5 semesters). The final required component for graduation is the successful oral defense of a written dissertation of the student's original research. This will be adjudicated by a committee containing no fewer than four members, all of whom, including the major advisor, must hold a doctoral degree. The dissertation committee will include the primary research advisor (acting as chair), at least two University faculty members who have expertise in the field, and at least one additional member who is either external to the University or external to the College of Engineering. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. program, students will have individualized programs of study for the required coursework. Each applicant is required to find a primary advisor prior to admission. This advisor is the primary academic contact for the student and is responsible for creating an individualized plan of study. In general, this will be the primary research advisor for the student as well, although the student may change advisor under special circumstances. This advisor is expected to evaluate each student's progress in the program at least once per academic year, with written evaluations shared with the student. Admissions decisions are made by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee with the addition of the student's primary advisor. Students wishing to change advisors after matriculation will be required to meet with the current advisor, proposed advisor, and Ph.D. program coordinator, who will together make a decision in the best interests of the student. Standards for admission are as follows: • Successful completion of an MS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5; or successful completion of a BS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5 • A strong statement of research aligned with the research expertise of one or more STEM-focused faculty at the University • Willingness of a STEM-focused faculty member in the University to supervise the candidate upon successful completion of the qualifying examination Goals of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program include: 1.

The program offers innovative curriculum in a flexible, online format with two short residencies to best meet student needs. Courses are facilitated by experienced faculty through an interdisciplinary and interprofessional approach. Coursework prepares students to critically analyze ongoing challenges in the health sciences, with a focus on one of two select concentrations: healthcare leadership or educational leadership. The program builds competencies to evaluate, plan, and implement solutions to these challenges in academe and clinical settings. The DHSc degree leads to a career in high-level administration, teaching, and applied research or practice, where advanced analytical and conceptual capabilities are essential to advance careers to top executive and academic appointments. Program Outcomes Upon completion of the Doctor of Health Sciences program, graduates will able to: Apply advanced knowledge in health sciences systems thinking, scholarship, pedagogy, and evidence-based practice. Develop an evidence based, innovative solution for a contemporary issue in healthcare. Demonstrate advanced communication skills by disseminating research findings to targeted audiences. Explain how Interprofessional Education (IPE) and Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC) relate to each other and why IPC is important in healthcare practice.

Research Options for Cellular and Molecular Biology Non-Thesis Option ( CMBI 6688 or CMBI 6689 or CMBI 6690) Thesis Option (CMBI 7695, CMBI 7698 & CMBI 7699) The thesis option is highly recommended for CMB students who wish to further their education in a Ph.D. or other doctoral program. Students who elect to write a thesis must include CMBI 7695 Independent Study for Thesis Preparation, CMBI 7698 and CMBI 7699 The first research course, CMBI 7695 Independent Study for Thesis Preparation, is designed to introduce the student to the specific research field and allow the student to develop the necessary research techniques as well as to work on the Thesis proposal and determine the committee members for the thesis. Prior to registering for CMBI 7698 Thesis I, the student must complete the Proposal for Thesis form and attach the Thesis proposal developed during CMBI 7695 in which the proposed subject, the methodology and the hypotheses are described. The student next secures an approval signature from the faculty member who will serve as the thesis adviser. The student must then receive approval for the proposed thesis and the thesis adviser from the Department Chair, Program Coordinator and the Provost's Office. Only after the Registrar has received the approval form with necessary signatures will the student be permitted to register for thesis. Completion of Thesis I is a prerequisite for Thesis II registration. The two may not be taken concurrently. A preliminary draft of the thesis must be presented to the adviser at least 75 days prior to commencement. The thesis adviser will then schedule the thesis defense before the student's thesis committee. Successful defense of the thesis, with any edits to the written thesis, must be completed at least three weeks prior to the date of commencement. Upon approval by the adviser and program coordinator, unbound copies are presented to the Provost's Office. Students must complete and defend the thesis within the time limit for completion of the degree. After successful defense and approval by the Provost's Office, thesis credit is awarded. Final, unbound copies of the thesis are deposited with the Provost's Office to be forwarded for binding at the University Library where they become part of the permanent collection. The Department or Program Coordinator may require additional copies of the thesis. For guidance in the preparation of theses, graduate students should consult the University's Dissertation & Thesis Manual (3rd edition, 2012). Questions not resolved by the instructions should be settled in consultation with the adviser and by reference to a standard style manual.

Students have the option, in consultation with a faculty advisor, of completing either a thesis or two research projects. Both these options represent an integrative piece of significant independent scholarship. The thesis will be larger in scope, more formal, and more rigorous than the projects, and it must involve a well-developed and systematically conducted research study. The projects may also be a piece of research, though narrower in scope and more focused than a thesis (e.g., a pilot study or a program evaluation); they may also involve the development, implementation and evaluation of an action-oriented intervention.

Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements. Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.

Students will master theory and techniques related to core areas of industrial-organizational psychology including talent identification and development, work motivation, training, human capital practices, organization and group behavior. 2. Students will learn how to employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities such as internships, practicum projects, case studies, and applied research projects. 3. Students will conduct applied organizational research and accurately interpret research used to make business decisions. A total of 42 credits is required of candidates for the master of arts degree in industrial/organizational psychology. Candidates for this degree must complete 24 credits of basic program requirements. Another 18 credits (including concentrations, program options, and electives) are chosen after consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student's academic and professional goals. Students may not complete more than nine credits of electives until they have satisfied the basic requirements. Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements. Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization.

Business intelligence as a discipline consists of a variety of business processes for data, information and knowledge management, and a wide range of analytical tools for performing analyses of qualitative and quantitative data. The ultimate goal is to deploy data-driven, evidence-based thinking in the service of strategic and tactical business decisions. Numerous companies, especially those engaged in global markets - routinely leverage data to optimize operations and for strategic decision making. Companies understand that the efficient use of the data available within and outside of an enterprise can be the single most important reason for its success. Government agencies have also increasingly adopted business intelligence practices to more efficiently discharge their regulatory and administrative functions. Graduates will be positioned for any number of jobs including: business intelligence developers, knowledge managers, strategic analysts, solution designers, managers, administrators, data warehouse managers, and forecasting and planning analysts.

Business intelligence as a discipline consists of a variety of business processes for data, information and knowledge management, and a wide range of analytical tools for performing analyses of qualitative and quantitative data. The ultimate goal is to deploy data-driven, evidence-based thinking in the service of strategic and tactical business decisions.

The discipline, however, has gained popularity and acceptance by engineers and technologists in non-defense sectors because it helps them navigate effectively the intricacies associated with complex systems. This 12-credit hour certificate is designed for professionals who wish to learn about and explore the concept of systems thinking, and acquire knowledge and expertise in the theory, applications, and approaches of systems engineering as applied to projects and products design and development. The required certificate courses also apply toward the requirements of the master of science in industrial engineering. Candidates for the certificate are expected to have the requisite background in computing, probability, and statistics. The program advisor, depending on the background of the candidate, may allow substitutions to best meet the professional need of the candidate. Program Educational Objectives The knowledge and skill set provided by the certificate in systems engineering program will enable its graduates to attain the following program educational objectives (PEOs): Graduates will be fully familiar with systems thinking and its advantages as they relate to both personal life and professional practice. Graduates will have a reservoir of knowledge, skills, and abilities to enable them to efficiently and effectively develop and apply any level of expertise in systems engineering and model-based systems engineering methodologies needed on their future projects. Graduates will be able to become effectively involved in service and/or leadership of the systems engineering profession and society at local, national, and global levels. Program Outcomes At the completion of the program, a student will be able to: Apply the systems engineering processes throughout the project life cycle to develop and achieve balances solutions to engineered systems. Develop key systems engineering artifacts using representative case project. Conduct technical reviews for an overall system (e.g. System Requirements Review, Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review).

Smith, Ph.D. The M.B.A./M.P.A. dual degree program is designed for those whose interests or career objectives are focused on both the public and private sectors of the economy. The program broadly stresses the use of management skills and analytic techniques applied to business, industrial, governmental, and not-for-profit organizations. The M.B.A./M.P.A. program consists of 68.5 credits. Up to 7.5 credits may be waived on the basis of undergraduate course work or work in public administration settings, leaving a minimum requirement of 61 credits. Waivers must be approved in writing by the appropriate department and are conditional upon subsequent academic performance. Graduate credit may be transferred from other accredited institutions subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog. Project/Thesis Requirement Students choose one of two alternatives for completion of the final six credits of course work in the M.B.A./M.P.A. dual degree curriculum. Most students take the two capstone/research project courses PADM 6690 - Research Seminar and MGMT 6669 - Strategic Management . Alternatively, students may elect to take the two-course, six-credit thesis option (Thesis I and II). If the thesis option is selected, the thesis must show ability to organize material in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific department requirements. Note: Thesis I and II are not permitted as substitutions for MGMT 6669. If the thesis option is selected, MGMT 6669 must still be completed as the capstone course for the M.B.A. program . Business Core Courses (waivable) Up to three business core courses (up to 4.5 credits) may be waived by students who meet the waiver guidelines established for these courses within the M.B.A. program; see M.B.A. program for information.
