Business intelligence as a discipline consists of a variety of business processes for data, information and knowledge management, and a wide range of analytical tools for performing analyses of qualitative and quantitative data. The ultimate goal is to deploy data-driven, evidence-based thinking in the service of strategic and tactical business decisions. Numerous companies, especially those engaged in global markets - routinely leverage data to optimize operations and for strategic decision making. Companies understand that the efficient use of the data available within and outside of an enterprise can be the single most important reason for its success. Government agencies have also increasingly adopted business intelligence practices to more efficiently discharge their regulatory and administrative functions. Graduates will be positioned for any number of jobs including: business intelligence developers, knowledge managers, strategic analysts, solution designers, managers, administrators, data warehouse managers, and forecasting and planning analysts.

The certificate in Nutritional Genomics provides the detailed understanding of the principles of nutritional genomics, such as how individual genetic variation can influence the assimilation and metabolism of nutrition and how nutrition can affect the expression of certain genes known to be involved in chronic diseases. It will introduce clinical genomic research tools and methods (gene expression profiling, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics), which prepare students to study an individual's response to their nutritional environment. It will also introduce individualized nutritional strategies to prevent chronic diseases and to optimize human health. Admission to the Nutritional Genomics Certificate: BS in Biology, Biotechnology, or Nutrition. It is expected that the applicant has significant background in one of the following fields: undergraduate biology, genetics, nutrition, organic chemistry, and/or biochemistry.
