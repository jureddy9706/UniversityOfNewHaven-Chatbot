      "Program Outcomes Evaluate the major theoretical models used to study crime and the administration of justice. Assess contemporary problems in crime and the administration of justice by utilizing a range of quantitative and qualitative research tools. Appraise the relationship between theory, research, and policy as applied to the study of crime and the administration of justice. Analyze complex problems and research questions related to crime and the administration of justice. Create and deliver oral and written communications that evaluate complex problems in crime and the administration of justice. Admissions All Ph.D. Programs must adhere to core admissions requirements. Programs of the various colleges may augment the core requirements with additional ones as appropriate. However, the minimum (core) requirements may not be waived or substituted under any circumstances. The core qualifications and admission requirements shall be as follows:  Given the specification of the program requirement below, applicants must possess a minimum of a Master's degree from an accredited college or university recognized and approved by the university. However, programs may admit students with Bachelor's degrees into their own Master's program with a plan of studies for transition to the Ph.D. upon successful completion of the Masters. One official transcript from each institution attended must accompany the application. These documents are to be submitted by the issuing academic institution(s) directly to the university. If the applicant's most recent degree was awarded more than ten years prior to the initial academic term of enrollment in the Ph.D. program, the candidate must demonstrate currency in the field to the satisfaction of the program administrator. Applicants must provide official reports of scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or other equivalent standardized examinations acceptable to the program, which have been taken no more than two years prior to the date of application to the university. These are to be submitted by the testing authority directly to the university. Applicants must furnish three confidential letters of recommendation. Two of the letters are to be from persons familiar with the candidate's scholarly abilities. The letters are to address specifically the applicant's (a) ability to conduct research in the proposed field of study, (b) writing ability, and (c) integrity. These letters are to be submitted directly to the university. Applicants must submit an essay of no more than 1,500 words describing the area of interest that the applicant proposes to pursue and the motivation for pursuing the degree. Applicants must submit an additional writing sample of previous academic, professional, or published work. Applicants must furnish a detailed resume or a curriculum vita. In the case of an applicant whose first language is not English, that applicant must furnish documented evidence of their ability to communicate (write, read, and speak), in English. All applicants to the university whose native language is not English must present satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the IELTS. Minimum TOEFL scores for admission to the Ph.D. program are 250 on the computer-generated score, 100 on the Internet-based test, or 600 on the paper-based test, or the IELTS equivalent. That test must have been taken within the two years immediately preceding the requested trimester of admission. In extraordinary circumstances, applicants who do not meet the above TOEFL scores may be admitted, but only with approval from the Dean of the College and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Applicants who have completed requirements for a bachelor's or a master's degree from an accredited U.S. university are not required to submit a TOEFL score. When a TOEFL score is a requirement for admission, individual graduate departments may require a TOEFL score higher than the threshold scores previously listed.   Application DeadlinesCandidates are strongly encouraged to submit their application documentation as early as possible. This is important because financial aid/assistantship/fellowship requests may have deadlines that do not mirror matriculation deadlines. Students may seek admission to begin enrollment during any term except where individual programs have restricted start terms. A letter of intent and the application may be submitted at any time for a specified future academic year. But, unless specified earlier by the particular program, the Office of Graduate Admissions must receive all of the documentation required by the College Program for which the applicant has applied no later than one and one-half months prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin (July 15th for fall matriculation). The applicant will be notified by the university of its decision to admit or not no later than one month prior to the anticipated date matriculation is to begin.Program Residency (Credit) RequirementsA minimum of forty-two credit hours beyond the master's degree are required for the Ph.D. degree apportioned as follows:  A minimum of 30 credit hours of course work corresponding to 10 or more courses is required. A minimum of three credit hours of research culminating in a prospectus for the dissertation is required. Candidates who do not complete their prospectus within the prescribed time will register for an additional three credit hours of prospectus research giving them additional time to complete the work. A minimum of 9 credit hours of dissertation research is required. Candidates will register for 3 credit hours of dissertation research per term while conducting the dissertation research. During these three academic terms, each 3-credit enrollment will be considered equivalent to full-time status. Candidates must register on a Continuing Registration basis upon completion of the 42 credit-hour requirements if they have not completed their dissertation. The minimum of 42 credit hours beyond the Master's degree presupposes that the applicant's Master's degree has been approved by the academic unit managing the Ph.D. as being sufficiently preparatory to that program. Full-time or part-time study may be pursued, subject to all time and qualitative requirements for the degree being satisfied. However, regardless of the mode of study, a candidate is required to devote at least three consecutive terms, or the equivalent, of full-time study for the dissertation research in residence at the main campus (or at a location appropriate to the dissertation research as approved by the dissertation committee and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies.) Time Limits It is expected that full-time students complete the 42 credit hours of course work, prospectus research, and dissertation research and writing within four calendar years. Students who have completed the 42 credit requirement without having actually completed the dissertation must register on a Continuing Registration basis. The maximum time allowed to earn the Ph.D. with the applicant having the Master's as a base is six years from the time one enrolls in the doctoral program. Under extraordinary circumstances and upon approval of the dissertation committee, and the Dean of the College, and the Provost's designee, an extension may be granted to complete the dissertation research, its defense and submittal. Registration/Enrollment Requirements/AdvisementIncoming doctoral students will work closely with the departmental coordinator of the program, or designee, to select appropriate courses and to plan for qualifying examinations. This coordinator will serve as the adviser of record until the student completes the required course work. At intervals determined by each program, a faculty committee chaired by the program coordinator will evaluate each student’s progress in the program, using criteria developed by the program. These written evaluations will be shared with the student. Doctoral students are encouraged to establish relationships with other faculty within the program during the first terms of study, and soon after passing the qualifying examinations, doctoral students should identify a primary dissertation adviser. This adviser will be designated the chair of the student’s doctoral dissertation committee. This committee will consist of three members or more, members and will be formed through consultation among the student, the adviser, and the coordinator of the graduate program and/or departmental chair. Doctoral dissertation committees must include at least two members of the department hosting the doctoral degree; at least one member from outside the home department, and, where appropriate, a member from outside the University.Grades and Satisfactory Progress Valid grades are those from the existing graduate set, A through F (including +/-), P/F for the dissertation credits, W, INC. Satisfactory Progress is defined as a cumulative QPR of 3.0 or greater. A student who falls below 3.0 (cumulative) would not be allowed to register without permission from the academic adviser. The adviser may permit a student not making satisfactory progress to register, but only with written conditions being set. If the conditions are not subsequently met, the student would not be permitted to continue in the program. Leave of Absence A leave of absence (LOA) from the Ph.D. program is an interruption in the formal program of study for extenuating circumstances and may only be taken with approval of Associate Provost for Graduate Studies, considering the academic department's recommendation. A LOA may be for personal, medical, professional, or parental reasons and may be granted for up to one year at a time. If more than one year is needed, another application would be required. A student must notify the registrar in writing of the intent to end the LOA and resume registering. Students may complete INC grades during a LOA, but no other formal program progress may be made during that time. The duration of an approved LOA will not be counted toward the time limits set to complete the Ph.D. program or its component phases. A LOA cannot be back-dated. A student not registered without an approved LOA will be presumed to have withdrawn from the program and will be notified in writing to that effect. Withdrawal and Re-admission Discipline and/or dismissal for non-academic causes follows existing university procedures and practices. Dismissal for academic cause follows the existing graduate policy and procedures. A student who voluntarily withdraws from a Ph.D. program or withdraws by virtue of non-registration may subsequently re-apply for admission. Such applications are judged by the admissions standards in force at the time of the subsequent application. If the student is re-admitted, they are subject to the program requirements in force at the time of re-admission. Previous credit earned will be evaluated in that light. Transfer Credit/Advance StandingA maximum of six credits may be transferred from other institutions with similar doctoral or relevant Master’s programs upon approval of the Dean and program coordinator.Foreign Language RequirementsThere is no University-wide language requirement for the doctoral degree. Please consult the requirements for individual programs to see whether a foreign language may be required for a particular program. Qualifying ExaminationsThe student is required to complete qualifying examinations in order to be admitted for candidacy for the dissertation. The program faculty is responsible for determination of the qualifying examination process and procedure as well as the exams themselves. The promulgated process and procedure must include a statement that addresses whether re-taking failed examinations are permitted and, if so, in what ways. The detailed schedule of requirements will be set and published by the specific program.Phases of Study – Candidacy for the Ph.D., Admission to Candidacy, Prospectus for the Dissertation—AcceptanceSuccessful completion of qualifying exams are required for admission to candidacy for the dissertation . Candidacy for the Ph.D. is formalized and recorded upon academic acceptance of the dissertation prospectus by the academic department. The latter is a pre-requisite for registration for any of the nine credits of required dissertation research. The dissertation must be successfully defended and approved and properly submitted for the Ph.D. degree to be granted. Program OversightThe responsibility for the college-wide oversight of the doctoral program rests with the Dean of the College where the program resides. The Dean may appoint a Director of the Doctoral Program if the volume of activity warrants it. The Dean’s Office or Director will work closely with assigned faculty advisors to facilitate and monitor student progress throughout the various phases of the program. The Associate Provost for Graduate Studies has university-wide oversight of all doctoral programs to ensure that institutional standards are met and procedures are followed.Dissertation FormatThe format for the dissertation is based on the University of New Haven’s Dissertation and Thesis Manual.Dissertation Defense, CompletionUpon recommendation of the student’s dissertation committee, the doctoral candidate will arrange a date for the dissertation defense. The defense should be scheduled prior to November 1 to allow for a Winter graduation or April 15 for the Spring commencement. At the defense, the Committee may request that additional corrections be made to the Dissertation, and will specify a timeline for the completion of these revisions. Final acceptance of the dissertation is contingent on approval by the dissertation committee, the Dean of the College, and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies.Financial Requirements/Financial SupportPlease refer to the graduate catalog for a schedule of tuition, doctoral program fee charges, and tuition assistance. A limited amount of tuition assistance based on need may be available. Support for tuition in the form of fellowship stipends, teaching fellowships, or research assistantships may be available from the specific college.  Personal Conduct/EthicsStudents in the doctoral program must strictly adhere to all elements of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, which addresses issues of research misconduct as well as plagiarism.Sponsored, Classified, Proprietary ResearchDissertation research proposals that involve national security classification implications or commercial undertakings related to the student’s employment interpreted as proprietary by that private-sector enterprise will be evaluated for acceptability as valid dissertation subject on a case-by-case basis.Intellectual PropertyThe student’s Intellectual Property rights are governed by the University’s guidelines as set forth in the Faculty Handbook. \n",

      "The research-based Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Engineering and Applied Science prepares students for positions in academia, industry, or consulting in a specific engineering or applied science discipline with coursework and research tailored to the student's particular interests and professional goals.\n",
      "Students identify a field of research at the time of admission that aligns with their career goals, previous educational experience, and existing faculty expertise. Disciplines represented include biomedical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, electrical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechanical engineering. Specific specializations will necessarily depend on faculty research interests which, based upon current active research groups, may include such fields as biomaterials for medical devices, tissue engineering, rapid detection of microbes, cybersecurity and forensics, artificial intelligence, data science, nondestructive evaluation, radar signal processing, renewable energy systems, wireless communication and advanced antennas, structural engineering, sustainability in engineering, and environmental remediation.\n",
      "Coursework is likewise tailored to a student's research interest and prior academic background.\n",
      "Students entering directly into the Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree will take at minimum 36 credits of coursework (12 courses: 3 Common, 9 Technical Core), of which 27 credits must be completed before taking the qualifying exam (3 semesters full-time). Students wanting a master's degree en passat must take an additional 15 credits of coursework (5 courses).\n",
      "Students entering with an appropriately preparatory master's degree may satisfy up to 18 credits of Technical Core courses. In this case students will require 18 credits of coursework taken at the University of New Haven (6 courses: 3 Common, 3 Technical Core), of which 9 credits must be completed prior to the qualifying exam (1 semester full-time). Students wanting a second master's degree must fully complete all requirements for that degree separate from the Ph.D. requirements.\n",
      "All Ph.D. students shall be required to take three 3-credit, 7000-level Common Courses covering research methods and ethics, grant writing and management, and focused technical knowledge at a post-master's level. Students will also take nine 3-credit graduate-level Technical Core courses following an individualized program of study which is developed prior to admission and generally follows existing master's degree worksheets of various programs within the College of Engineering.\n",
      "Students will take the qualifying exam after their first (students entering with master's degrees) or third (students entering with bachelor's degrees) semester. These exams will be offered twice a year, before the start of the fall and spring semesters. The format of this exam will be decided by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee (containing members from each program represented in the Ph.D. program appointed by the Dean and chaired by the Ph.D. program coordinator) with input from the students' programs. Students will have at most two attempts. Students not passing the qualifying exam are dismissed from the Ph.D. program but should have completed the requirements for a master's degree.\n",
      "Students successfully passing the qualifying exam become Ph.D. candidates and are enrolled in Dissertation Research (3 credits each semester, counts as full-time enrollment). Students must complete a minimum of 15 credits of Dissertation Research (5 semesters).\n",
      "The final required component for graduation is the successful oral defense of a written dissertation of the student's original research. This will be adjudicated by a committee containing no fewer than four members, all of whom, including the major advisor, must hold a doctoral degree. The dissertation committee will include the primary research advisor (acting as chair), at least two University faculty members who have expertise in the field, and at least one additional member who is either external to the University or external to the College of Engineering.\n",
      "Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. program, students will have individualized programs of study for the required coursework. Each applicant is required to find a primary advisor prior to admission. This advisor is the primary academic contact for the student and is responsible for creating an individualized plan of study. In general, this will be the primary research advisor for the student as well, although the student may change advisor under special circumstances. This advisor is expected to evaluate each student's progress in the program at least once per academic year, with written evaluations shared with the student.\n",
      "Admissions decisions are made by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee with the addition of the student's primary advisor. Students wishing to change advisors after matriculation will be required to meet with the current advisor, proposed advisor, and Ph.D. program coordinator, who will together make a decision in the best interests of the student.\n",
      "Standards for admission are as follows:\n",
      "•           Successful completion of an MS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5; or successful completion of a BS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5\n",
      "•           A strong statement of research aligned with the research expertise of one or more STEM-focused faculty at the University\n",
      "•           Willingness of a STEM-focused faculty member in the University to supervise the candidate upon successful completion of the qualifying examination\n",
      "Goals of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program include:\n",
      "1.         Preparing exceptional students for careers at academic institutions and industry\n",
      "2.         Offering students the knowledge and experiences required to respond to 21st century challenges across a broad field of specialties\n",
      "3.         Training students to conduct research and disseminate results in an ethical and professional manner\n",
      "4.         Providing a curriculum that develops critical and analytical thinking skills through an integrative approach of instruction, research, and evidence-based practices\n",
      "Upon completion of the Ph.D. in Engineering and Applied Science program, graduates will be able to: \n",
      "1.         Apply critical thinking skills in foundational areas of engineering and applied science.\n",
      "2.         Detail the current state of knowledge in an engineering or applied science specialty and apply it to solve modern problems.\n",
      "3.         Integrate knowledge and skills to design, conduct, analyze, and publish original research findings.\n",
      "4.         Illustrate effective skills in technical written and oral communication.\n",

      "The Doctor of Health Sciences (DHSc) program prepares professionals to be effective leaders and change agents in a variety of settings in which healthcare is taught or practiced. The program offers innovative curriculum in a flexible, online format with two short residencies to best meet student needs. Courses are facilitated by experienced faculty through an interdisciplinary and interprofessional approach. Coursework prepares students to critically analyze ongoing challenges in the health sciences, with a focus on one of two select concentrations: healthcare leadership or educational leadership. The program builds competencies to evaluate, plan, and implement solutions to these challenges in academe and clinical settings. The DHSc degree leads to a career in high-level administration, teaching, and applied research or practice, where advanced analytical and conceptual capabilities are essential to advance careers to top executive and academic appointments.\n",

In this option, a student would complete a substantial and extensive amount of work, as would be required in options 2 and 3 below. If a student does not complete project requirement in the course, they will need to enroll in BIOM 6690 and complete the project requirement in BIOM 6690. A student will be completing 3 credits whether they complete the project requirement during the project-based course or through BIOM 6690. This option offers a student the advantage of working on a project in a chosen focus area under the guidance of faculty in that specialty.  Listed below are the set of special project-based courses from which a student will make a selection. BIOM 6615  -  Biomaterials II: Design and Applications of Biomaterials BIOM 6620  - Tissue Engineering BIOM 6650  - Medical Imaging Systems ELEC 6653  - Digital Image Processing  2. BIOM 6690   Research Project (this course will count as an elective). Student must find an advisor, prepare a project proposal and obtain written approval for the project prior to registration. This option offers an advantage to students who may choose to explore areas outside the curriculum.  3. BIOM 6697   Thesis I and BIOM 6697 Thesis II (these courses will count as electives with biomaterials, imaging, or biomechanics content). Students who plan to complete a thesis should find a thesis advisor in their first or second semester, prepare a thesis proposal, and obtain written approval       for the thesis prior to registration. For the thesis option, both BIOM 6697 and BIOM 6698 must be completed. \n",

Student can choose from these courses after a minimum of 18 credit hours of graduate course work with a minimum GPA of 3.0 and the approval of program coordinator.Thesis Option (CMBI 7695, CMBI 7698 & CMBI 7699)The thesis option is highly recommended for CMB students who wish to further their education in a Ph.D. or other doctoral program. Students who elect to write a thesis must include CMBI 7695 Independent Study for Thesis Preparation, CMBI 7698  and CMBI 7699  , Thesis I and II or the chemistry or physics equivalents. All the research for the thesis must be performed at the University of New Haven, and must be advised by full time faculty members of the University and one of the advising faculty members should be selected from the Department of Biology and Environmental Science. Students can select the Thesis option after completing 9 to 20 credit hours of graduate study with a minimum GPA of 3.3 and the approval of the program coordinator. The first research course, CMBI 7695  Independent Study for Thesis Preparation, is designed to introduce the student to the specific research field and allow the student to develop the necessary research techniques as well as to work on the Thesis proposal and determine the committee members for the thesis. Prior to registering for CMBI 7698 Thesis I, the student must complete the Proposal for Thesis form and attach the Thesis proposal developed during CMBI 7695 in which the proposed subject, the methodology and the hypotheses are described. The student next secures an approval signature from the faculty member who will serve as the thesis adviser. The student must then receive approval for the proposed thesis and the thesis adviser from the Department Chair, Program Coordinator and the Provost's Office. Only after the Registrar has received the approval form with necessary signatures will the student be permitted to register for thesis. Completion of Thesis I is a prerequisite for Thesis II registration. The two may not be taken concurrently. A preliminary draft of the thesis must be presented to the adviser at least 75 days prior to commencement.  The thesis adviser will then schedule the thesis defense before the student's thesis committee. Successful defense of the thesis, with any edits to the written thesis, must be completed at least three weeks prior to the date of commencement. Upon approval by the adviser and program coordinator, unbound copies are presented to the Provost's Office. Students must complete and defend the thesis within the time limit for completion of the degree. After successful defense and approval by the Provost's Office, thesis credit is awarded. Final, unbound copies of the thesis are deposited with the Provost's Office to be forwarded for binding at the University Library where they become part of the permanent collection. The Department or Program Coordinator may require additional copies of the thesis. For guidance in the preparation of theses, graduate students should consult the University's Dissertation & Thesis Manual (3rd edition, 2012). Questions not resolved by the instructions should be settled in consultation with the adviser and by reference to a standard style manual. The University of New Haven participates in the University Microfilms, Inc. (UMI) Dissertation Services program and provides assistance to doctoral students for registration of dissertations and copyrights.   \n",

      "STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php.\n",
      "The Master of Science in Chemical Engineering program at the University of New Haven is a 30-credit hour program designed to prepare students to lead projects that require knowledge of systems engineering and complex chemistry, biomolecular, and energy systems and computational methods. This program will equip students with the ability to design, manage, and optimize these systems for the rapidly changing products and technologies of the future. Students will acquire knowledge in advanced chemical engineering kinetics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and transport and computational methods for engineering chemical, biomolecular, and energy systems, together with skills of project design and management and entrepreneurial mindset through projects. This integrative approach will be implemented through a core curriculum (i.e., list of required courses) that integrates the theoretical/computational chemical engineering courses with systems engineering, chemistry, and energy courses. This is different than traditional MS chemical engineering programs where systems engineering and chemical, biomolecular, and energy systems training may not be a part of the core curriculum. Students enrolled in the program may choose to engage in cutting-edge, integrative research in chemical process engineering, energy engineering, and biomolecular engineering. Such research may require interdisciplinary work involving biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, biomedical engineering, environmental science and engineering, data science, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering. Graduates of the program can pursue career paths as junior/senior engineer, developer, or manager in the chemical process, energy, pharmaceutical, materials, manufacturing, biotechnology, and computational data analysis industries, and as researchers in academic institutions and government.\n",
      "Program Outcomes\n",
      "Students will:\n",
      "1. Develop appropriate experimentation or computer simulation in a master's level project.\n",
      "2. Interpret data to draw conclusions to enable an informed engineering judgement.\n",
      "3. Apply mathematics, science, and engineering concepts to solve chemical engineering problems.\n",
      "4. Demonstrate effective oral and written communication skills to both experts in the field and non-expert scientists and engineers.\n",

There are three different ways that a student can satisfy the project requirement:  CHEM 6685 Graduate Research Project (restricted elective).  Students must find an advisor, prepare a project proposal and obtain written approval for the project prior to registration.  This option offers an advantage to students who may choose to explore areas outside the curriculum. CHEM 6698 Thesis I and CHEM 6699 Thesis II (restricted electives).  Students who plan to do a thesis should find a thesis advisor in their first or second semester, prepare a thesis proposal, and obtain written approval for the thesis prior to registration.  For this option, both CHEM 6698 and CHEM 6699 must be completed. CHEM 6688 Graduate Internship (restricted elective). Students must find a company or research-related organization that will host students to conduct an internship activity related to chemistry research, such as computational modeling, chemical synthesis, chemical characterization, or chemical processing. An evaluation of the internship performance will be provided by the internship supervisor.  \n",

      "M.A. Community PsychologyCommunity psychology focuses on solutions to human problems in a wide variety of settings, by developing theory, research and practice to enhance the functioning of individuals, families, groups, institutions, and entire communities. This program consists of 36 credits, 21 of which compose the core curriculum completed by all students (including two semesters of fieldwork - the program's capstone project), and 9 of which constitute an area of concentration. The remaining 6 credits are electives. Program Outcomes 1. Students will successfully conduct applied social research relevant to community psychology. 2. Students successfully apply major theoretical concepts in the core community psychology curriculum.  3. Students demonstrate, at a professional level, applied intervention skills in an internship setting relevant to their concentration.Required CoursesPSYC 6605 - Foundations of Community PsychologyPSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological SciencePSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6610 - Program EvaluationPSYC 6614 - Intervention Fieldwork and SeminarPSYC 6615 - Consultation Fieldwork and SeminarSOCI 6602 - Social Inequalities in OrganizationsPlus two courses (6 credits) from the following prefixes: PSYC, COUN, SOCI, CJST, PADM, or PUBHConcentration in Community Research and EvaluationThe community research and evaluation concentration prepares students for careers in research labs or organizations and/or who are thinking of going on to a doctoral program and a possible career in university teaching and research. Students have the option, in consultation with a faculty advisor, of completing either a thesis or two research projects. Both these options represent an integrative piece of significant independent scholarship. The thesis will be larger in scope, more formal, and more rigorous than the projects, and it must involve a well-developed and systematically conducted research study. The projects may also be a piece of research, though narrower in scope and more focused than a thesis (e.g., a pilot study or a program evaluation); they may also involve the development, implementation and evaluation of an action-oriented intervention.PSYC 6604 - Qualitative Research Methods \n",

      "STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php\n",
      "The Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) is designed to provide students and practicing engineers alike with a background in analysis, design, development, or research on electrical or computer engineering in a variety of technical areas. It enables students to expand and deepen their knowledge beyond the baccalaureate degree and gives them the ability to adapt to ever-changing technological developments. Students with adequate background in electrical or digital and computer systems can complete the MSEE degree by successfully completing a minimum of 30 credits of course and project work.  Six additional waivable credits are assigned as bridge courses as needed. In such cases when these are assigned, students will be informed at the time of admission.\n",

      "Unique FeaturesAreas of research and study at the graduate level include:  Autonomy and robotics, Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Electrical Engineering, Control systems and robotics, Smart grid and power systems. Communications/ digital signal processing, Embedded systems, Computer networks, Nanotechnology.  The ECE faculty research page can be accessed here. Transfer Credit The transfer of graduate credit from other institutions may be permitted with the approval of the program coordinator and subject to Graduate School policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog. Financial Support Financial support is available through teaching or research assistantships. Financial support is offered to those students who, in the estimation of the Department faculty, hold greatest promise of being successful graduate students.Admission PolicyEach applicant will be evaluated based on the academic performance and the promise of success in the program. Applicants with a GPA of 3.0 or better in a baccalaureate program in electrical engineering, computer engineering, or a closely related discipline from an ABET accredited program or equivalent will have the highest chance of being accepted into the program.  A minimum of 30 credits (10 courses) are required for applicants with strong preparation in their bachelor's degree. The M.S.E.E. program at the University of New Haven strives to ensure that all incoming students are aligned appropriately with the mission of the program and prepared for successful completion of graduate level coursework. To effectively assess academic ability, graduates from American universities are encouraged.  International applicants are required to submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) to be considered for admission and scholarships.  Applicants with strong academic or professional experience but with gaps in some areas may be asked to complete additional courses beyond the 30 credits from electrical engineering or other disciplines.  In such cases students will be informed at the time of admission.  Courses may include the following:   ELEC 5501 - Digital Systems ELEC 6602 - Embedded Systems ELEC 6603 - Discrete and Continuous Systems I Degree RequirementsStudents must complete one of the following three options to complete the MSEE degree:    Thesis Option: Complete 24 credits of course work (8 courses) plus 6 credits of thesis (ELEC 6697 Thesis I and ELEC 6698 Thesis II). For this option, a student conducts research under the supervision of a faculty member. A student can register in Thesis I only after the approval of the proposal for the thesis by the graduate coordinator or academic advisor and other approvals as needed. Research Project Option: Complete 27 credits of course work (9 courses) and the Research Project (ELEC 6690). For this option, a student works with a faculty member on a research project.  A student can register in this course only after the approval of the proposal for the project by the graduate coordinator or academic advisor. Course option: Complete 30 credits of course work. At least one of the courses must be a designated project course.  Thesis Committee (for thesis option only):  Students pursuing the thesis option must work closely with their thesis advisor in preparation of the Master's thesis. A thesis proposal must receive the approval of the thesis advisor, program coordinator, department chair, and the dean of the college of engineering before a student is permitted to register for thesis course(s). A thesis committee consisting of 3 faculty members from the student's major program area must be formed well in advance of the defense of the thesis.Required CoursesThe following courses are mandatory for all MSEE students (ELEC 5501, ELEC 6602, and ELEC 6603 may be waived):ELEC 5501 - Digital SystemsELEC 6602 - Embedded SystemsELEC 6603 - Discrete and Continuous Systems IELEC 6634 - Digital Signal Processing IELEC 6650 - Random Processes in Communications and DSPElectivesThe remaining credits beyond the required courses may be taken from the electrical engineering courses listed below or other closely related disciplines with the approval of the MSEE program coordinator.

      "M.S. Environmental ScienceSTEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php   Program Outcomes  Demonstrate knowledge of the interdisciplinary fields of environmental science. Use advanced technologies and the scientific method to address environmental problems. Communicate concepts from Environmental Science effectively. Critically analyze interdisciplinary environmental problems. Assess scientific literature utilizing available scientific information.    A minimum of 38 - 40 credits must be completed to earn the master of science in environmental science degree. The transfer of credit earned at other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog. The program consists of five required core courses, additional courses that may be taken in a specified area of concentration, and a capstone. Note that students who do not choose to concentrate in a particular area are required to follow a plan of study determined in consultation with the program coordinator. Required courses cover common areas in environmental science, while the electives and concentration requirements enable students to study in a particular area of interest or in subjects with direct application to their profession. Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements. A thesis is recommended for students who wish to pursue doctoral training after graduation and for those with specific professional interests. For students who choose the thesis option, the selection of thesis courses is determined in consultation with the program coordinator and the thesis advisor, and includes ENVS 6698 - Thesis I and ENVS 6699 - Thesis II in lieu of other courses in the program. Students who do not pursue a thesis have the option of completing a one-semester research project or internship. Students should note that a number of courses in this program require weekend field trips, lab sessions, or acceptable alternatives. In addition, students should consult the program coordinator for advice on selection of appropriate courses and on assuring compliance with prerequisites.Core CoursesCIVL 6606 - Environmental Law and LegislationorMPMA 6602 - Marine and Coastal Law ENVS 6011 - Scientific Literature and Proposal WritingENVS 6600 - Environmental Geoscience with LaboratoryENVS 6601 - Ecological Applications in Environmental Science with LaboratoryENVS 6609 - Data Analysis in the Environmental and Biological SciencesConcentrationsStudents may elect to pursue one of the following concentrations for the elective portion of the program:  Environmental Ecology, Environmental Geoscience, Environmental Health and Management, Geographical Information Systems and Applications, or Marine Biology.  As students declare a concentration, they are assigned to the faculty advisor responsible for it, and the advisor helps the student formulate an individual program and the approved electives.

      "M.S. Environmental ScienceSTEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php   Program Outcomes  Demonstrate knowledge of the interdisciplinary fields of environmental science. Use advanced technologies and the scientific method to address environmental problems. Communicate concepts from Environmental Science effectively. Critically analyze interdisciplinary environmental problems. Assess scientific literature utilizing available scientific information.    A minimum of 38 - 40 credits must be completed to earn the master of science in environmental science degree. The transfer of credit earned at other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog. The program consists of five required core courses, additional courses that may be taken in a specified area of concentration, and a capstone. Note that students who do not choose to concentrate in a particular area are required to follow a plan of study determined in consultation with the program coordinator. Required courses cover common areas in environmental science, while the electives and concentration requirements enable students to study in a particular area of interest or in subjects with direct application to their profession. Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements. A thesis is recommended for students who wish to pursue doctoral training after graduation and for those with specific professional interests. For students who choose the thesis option, the selection of thesis courses is determined in consultation with the program coordinator and the thesis advisor, and includes ENVS 6698 - Thesis I and ENVS 6699 - Thesis II in lieu of other courses in the program. Students who do not pursue a thesis have the option of completing a one-semester research project or internship. Students should note that a number of courses in this program require weekend field trips, lab sessions, or acceptable alternatives. In addition, students should consult the program coordinator for advice on selection of appropriate courses and on assuring compliance with prerequisites.Core CoursesCIVL 6606 - Environmental Law and LegislationorMPMA 6602 - Marine and Coastal Law ENVS 6011 - Scientific Literature and Proposal WritingENVS 6600 - Environmental Geoscience with LaboratoryENVS 6601 - Ecological Applications in Environmental Science with LaboratoryENVS 6609 - Data Analysis in the Environmental and Biological SciencesConcentrationsStudents may elect to pursue one of the following concentrations for the elective portion of the program:  Environmental Ecology, Environmental Geoscience, Environmental Health and Management, Geographical Information Systems and Applications, or Marine Biology.  As students declare a concentration, they are assigned to the faculty advisor responsible for it, and the advisor helps the student formulate an individual program and the approved electives. Concentrations require a minimum of 21-23 credits in addition to the required core courses.  If no concentration is pursued, students must consult with the program coordinator to determine the appropriate 21-23 credits that must be taken in addition to the required core courses.Capstone RequirementDepending upon their track, students will choose from the following capstone project options:  Internship Track: ENVS 6692  - Internship Non-Thesis Track: ENVS 6690  - Research Project Thesis Track: ENVS 6698  and ENVS 6699  - Thesis I and Thesis II General Elective CoursesPossible elective courses for the General concentration:ENVS 6200 - Advanced OceanographyENVS 6201 - Advanced Marine Organismal BiologyENVS 6310 - Algal Research MethodsENVS 6320 - Marine PollutionENVS 6331 - Marine Conservation and RestorationENVS 6400 - Tropical Marine EcologyENVS 6440 - Aquaculture IENVS 6444 - Aquaculture IIENVS 6602 - Environmental Effects of PollutantsENVS 6603 - Wetlands Ecology with LaboratoryENVS 6604 - Ecology of Inland WatersENVS 6605 - Marine and Estuarine Ecology with LaboratoryENVS 6607 - Environmental Reports and Impact AssessmentENVS 6608 - Landscape EcologyENVS 6610 - Environmental HealthENVS 6616 - Human Health and Environmental Risk AssessmentENVS 6617 - Subsurface AssessmentENVS 6632 - Field Geology of the NortheastENVS 6633 - Selected Topics in Field GeologyENVS 6634 - Environmental Education Instructor ClinicENVS 6640 - Introduction to Geographical Information SystemsENVS 6641 - Geographical Information System Techniques and Applications IENVS 6642 - Geographical Information System Techniques and Applications IIENVS 6643 - Advanced Applications of GISENVS 6653 - Environmental MicrobiologyENVS 6695 - Independent Study IENGL 6659 - Writing and Speaking for Professionals \n",

      "M.A. Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram Goals 1.  Students will master theory and techniques related to core areas of industrial-organizational psychology including talent identification and development, work motivation, training, human capital practices, organization and group behavior. 2.  Students will learn how to employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities such as internships, practicum projects, case studies, and applied research projects. 3.  Students will conduct applied organizational research and accurately interpret research used to make business decisions.   A total of 42 credits is required of candidates for the master of arts degree in industrial/organizational psychology. Candidates for this degree must complete 24 credits of basic program requirements. Another 18 credits (including concentrations, program options, and electives) are chosen after consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student's academic and professional goals. Students may not complete more than nine credits of electives until they have satisfied the basic requirements. Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog   Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements.   Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.  Required Courses (24 credits)ECON 6625 - Industrial RelationsorPSYC 6626 - Worker Well-Being PSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological Science *PSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6619 - Organizational BehaviorPSYC 6620 - Industrial PsychologyPSYC 6635 - Psychological Tests and Measurements in OrganizationsPSYC 6645 - Seminar in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyPSYC 6660 - Contemporary Issues in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram option** (18 credits)Option 1 (Thesis)PSYC 6698 - Thesis IPSYC 6699 - Thesis IIElectives ** (12 credits)Option 2 (Internship/Practicum)PSYC 6693 - Organizational Internship IPSYC 6694 - Organizational Internship IIorPSYC 6678 - Practicum I Electives ** (15 credits)Option 3 (Approved Electives) Comprehensive examination required Electives ** (18 credits) Note(s):*Undergraduate preparation in statistics is prerequisite. **Chosen in consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student’s academic and professional goals.General Concentration Electives (12 credits)  Consult with the program coordinator to select electives in light of your academic and professional goals.  These 12 required concentration credits count toward the program option selected. \n",

      "M.A. Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram Goals 1.  Students will master theory and techniques related to core areas of industrial-organizational psychology including talent identification and development, work motivation, training, human capital practices, organization and group behavior. 2.  Students will learn how to employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities such as internships, practicum projects, case studies, and applied research projects. 3.  Students will conduct applied organizational research and accurately interpret research used to make business decisions.   A total of 42 credits is required of candidates for the master of arts degree in industrial/organizational psychology. Candidates for this degree must complete 24 credits of basic program requirements. Another 18 credits (including concentrations, program options, and electives) are chosen after consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student's academic and professional goals. Students may not complete more than nine credits of electives until they have satisfied the basic requirements. Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog   Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements.   Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.  Required Courses (24 credits)ECON 6625 - Industrial RelationsorPSYC 6626 - Worker Well-Being PSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological Science *PSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6619 - Organizational BehaviorPSYC 6620 - Industrial PsychologyPSYC 6635 - Psychological Tests and Measurements in OrganizationsPSYC 6645 - Seminar in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyPSYC 6660 - Contemporary Issues in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram option** (18 credits)Option 1 (Thesis)PSYC 6698 - Thesis IPSYC 6699 - Thesis IIElectives ** (12 credits)Option 2 (Internship/Practicum)PSYC 6693 - Organizational Internship IPSYC 6694 - Organizational Internship IIorPSYC 6678 - Practicum I Electives ** (15 credits)Option 3 (Approved Electives) Comprehensive examination required Electives ** (18 credits) Note(s):*Undergraduate preparation in statistics is prerequisite. **Chosen in consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student’s academic and professional goals.Concentration in Industrial-Human Resources PsychologyThese 12 required concentration credits count toward the program option selected:PSYC 6641 - Training and Development in OrganizationsPSYC 6644 - Performance Management ProcessesPlus two of the following: MGMT 6645 - Management of Human ResourcesPSYC 6610 - Program EvaluationPSYC 6628 - The InterviewPSYC 6640 - Workplace Motivation and Attitudes \n",

      "M.A. Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram Goals 1.  Students will master theory and techniques related to core areas of industrial-organizational psychology including talent identification and development, work motivation, training, human capital practices, organization and group behavior. 2.  Students will learn how to employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities such as internships, practicum projects, case studies, and applied research projects. 3.  Students will conduct applied organizational research and accurately interpret research used to make business decisions.   A total of 42 credits is required of candidates for the master of arts degree in industrial/organizational psychology. Candidates for this degree must complete 24 credits of basic program requirements. Another 18 credits (including concentrations, program options, and electives) are chosen after consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student's academic and professional goals. Students may not complete more than nine credits of electives until they have satisfied the basic requirements. Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog   Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements.   Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.  Required Courses (24 credits)ECON 6625 - Industrial RelationsorPSYC 6626 - Worker Well-Being PSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological Science *PSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6619 - Organizational BehaviorPSYC 6620 - Industrial PsychologyPSYC 6635 - Psychological Tests and Measurements in OrganizationsPSYC 6645 - Seminar in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyPSYC 6660 - Contemporary Issues in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram option** (18 credits)Option 1 (Thesis)PSYC 6698 - Thesis IPSYC 6699 - Thesis IIElectives ** (12 credits)Option 2 (Internship/Practicum)PSYC 6693 - Organizational Internship IPSYC 6694 - Organizational Internship IIorPSYC 6678 - Practicum I Electives ** (15 credits)Option 3 (Approved Electives) Comprehensive examination required Electives ** (18 credits) Note(s):*Undergraduate preparation in statistics is prerequisite. **Chosen in consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student’s academic and professional goals.Concentration in Organizational Development and ConsultationThese 12 required concentration credits count toward the program option selected:PSYC 6642 - Organizational Change and DevelopmentPSYC 6612 - Consultation SeminarPlus two of the following: MGMT 6663 - Leadership and Team BuildingPSYC 6623 - Psychology of the Small GroupPSYC 6624 - Exploring Group DynamicsPSYC 6638 - Psychology of Communication and Influence in OrganizationsPSYC 6640 - Workplace Motivation and AttitudesPSYC 6641 - Training and Development in OrganizationsPSYC 6643 - The Psychology of Conflict Resolution \n",

      "M.A. Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram Goals 1.  Students will master theory and techniques related to core areas of industrial-organizational psychology including talent identification and development, work motivation, training, human capital practices, organization and group behavior. 2.  Students will learn how to employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities such as internships, practicum projects, case studies, and applied research projects. 3.  Students will conduct applied organizational research and accurately interpret research used to make business decisions.   A total of 42 credits is required of candidates for the master of arts degree in industrial/organizational psychology. Candidates for this degree must complete 24 credits of basic program requirements. Another 18 credits (including concentrations, program options, and electives) are chosen after consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student's academic and professional goals. Students may not complete more than nine credits of electives until they have satisfied the basic requirements. Up to nine credits of electives may be taken in other departments, such as industrial engineering, economics, management, marketing, business analytics and public administration. Transfer Credit The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer of credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog   Thesis Students may elect to write a thesis as part of the program of study. The thesis must show ability to organize materials in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific departmental requirements.   Program Options Students have the opportunity to develop a program that meets their particular needs and interests by choosing from many elective courses and various program options. These options include a thesis, for those interested in future pursuit of a doctoral degree; an internship, for those interested in a practical introduction to an organizational environment; or a practicum, for those already employed. Option 1 (Thesis) is intended primarily for those who are interested in continuing their education in doctoral-level programs. This option gives students the research experience necessary to be successful in pursuit of admission to and completion of a Ph.D. program. Option 2 (Internship/Practicum) allows the student to acquire special skills by coordinating formal course work with an internship or practicum in an organizational setting. The internship gives the student with limited work experience opportunity to work in cooperating organizations or consulting firms. The practicum experience is for the student who is currently employed. The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.  Required Courses (24 credits)ECON 6625 - Industrial RelationsorPSYC 6626 - Worker Well-Being PSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological Science *PSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6619 - Organizational BehaviorPSYC 6620 - Industrial PsychologyPSYC 6635 - Psychological Tests and Measurements in OrganizationsPSYC 6645 - Seminar in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyPSYC 6660 - Contemporary Issues in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram option** (18 credits)Option 1 (Thesis)PSYC 6698 - Thesis IPSYC 6699 - Thesis IIElectives ** (12 credits)Option 2 (Internship/Practicum)PSYC 6693 - Organizational Internship IPSYC 6694 - Organizational Internship IIorPSYC 6678 - Practicum I Electives ** (15 credits)Option 3 (Approved Electives) Comprehensive examination required Electives ** (18 credits) Note(s):*Undergraduate preparation in statistics is prerequisite. **Chosen in consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student’s academic and professional goals.Concentration in Talent AnalyticsStudents choosing this STEM eligible concentration will be able to apply techniques of data analytics to workplace and talent management.   Specifically, students will be equipped with knowledge and skills needed to source, analyze, and visualize workplace related data to inform decisions and make recommendations that will enhance organizational success.  As an interdisciplinary concentration, it will make use of existing resources in the Pompea College of Business and the Tagliatela College of Engineering, along with  specific applications to I/O psychology and talent management.

The content of the practicum or internship is established jointly by the cooperating organization, the program coordinator, and the student. A comprehensive project report is required in which the student analyzes and integrates internship/practicum experiences with relevant research and coursework. Option 3 (Approved Electives) consists of elective courses selected under faculty advisement. The choice of electives is intended to provide the student with a broad interdisciplinary background, complementing the student's own academic training and interests. A comprehensive examination covering material from the required psychology courses is required under this option. Program Concentrations Within each program option described above, students may concentrate in industrial-human resources, organizational development, conflict management, or talent analytics. A concentration requires 12 credits of electives, which are counted as part of the 18 credits required in the elective option (Thesis, Internship/Practicum, or Approved Electives) selected by the student. If a concentration is selected, the student must notify the program coordinator as well as the Registrar. A concentration is not required if the student's educational or career goals can best be met without this specialization. Program Outcomes By the end of this program, students will be able to: 1) Apply core industrial-organization psychology models, practices and techniques to understand and solve IO- related Psychology problems. 2) Employ the knowledge gained through their classes to the workplace through supervised experiential learning opportunities. 3) Employ statistical and research methods to conduct applied organizational research that can be accurately interpreted and used to make business decisions.  Required Courses (24 credits)ECON 6625 - Industrial RelationsorPSYC 6626 - Worker Well-Being PSYC 6608 - Statistics for Psychological Science *PSYC 6609 - Research MethodsPSYC 6619 - Organizational BehaviorPSYC 6620 - Industrial PsychologyPSYC 6635 - Psychological Tests and Measurements in OrganizationsPSYC 6645 - Seminar in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyPSYC 6660 - Contemporary Issues in Industrial/Organizational PsychologyProgram option** (18 credits)Option 1 (Thesis)PSYC 6698 - Thesis IPSYC 6699 - Thesis IIElectives ** (12 credits)Option 2 (Internship/Practicum)PSYC 6693 - Organizational Internship IPSYC 6694 - Organizational Internship IIorPSYC 6678 - Practicum I Electives ** (15 credits)Option 3 (Approved Electives) Comprehensive examination required Electives ** (18 credits) Note(s):*Undergraduate preparation in statistics is prerequisite. **Chosen in consultation with the program coordinator in light of the student’s academic and professional goals.Concentration in The Psychology of Conflict ManagementThese 12 required concentration credits count toward the program option selected:PSYC 6643 - The Psychology of Conflict ResolutionPSYC 6646 - The Psychology of Negotiation and MediationPlus two of the following: MGMT 6667 - Multicultural Issues in the WorkplacePSYC 6612 - Consultation SeminarPSYC 6623 - Psychology of the Small GroupPSYC 6638 - Psychology of Communication and Influence in OrganizationsPSYC 6640 - Workplace Motivation and AttitudesPSYC 6647 - Industrial and Organizational Psychology in Global SettingsPSCI 6655 - Conflict Resolution \n",

      "The decision by government to utilize its taxing authority to pursue a variety of economic and social goals has led to the development of a complex body of tax law. Given the dynamic state of society's economic and social goals, the body of tax law characteristically exists in a continual state of change. The complexity of tax law is significant because of its influence on the economic decision-making process and because of its impact on the successful achievement of society's goals. Tax consequences have been and will continue to be an important financial consideration.\n",
      "Program Outcomes\n",
      "1.  Apply the economic, political, and social objectives of tax legislation within functional areas of taxation.\n",
      "2.  Provide recommendations and alternatives for action in a tax planning business situation.\n",
      "3.  Analyze the ethical and social ramifications of tax compliance and planning decisions.\n",
      "4.  Apply research tools to develop tax strategies.\n",
      "5.  Produce communications that use appropriate tools of analysis in reaching conclusions and recommendations.\n",
      "Admission Policy\n",
      "Admission to the program is available to accountants, CPAs, attorneys, businesspeople and those holding an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution.\n",
      "Candidates for admission must meet the same graduate business program admission requirements outlined for the M.B.A. program. Admission is based primarily on an applicant's undergraduate record and work experience; however, the promise of academic success is the essential factor for admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 30 credits hours, including a research project, are required for the Master of Science in Taxation degree. The transfer of credit from other institutions is permitted subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit and residency requirements detailed elsewhere in this catalog.\n",
      "Accountants and practitioners wishing to improve or update their skills, or practicing CPAs in need of continuing education credits, and others seeking to expand their tax backgrounds but uncertain about pursuing a master's in taxation, should consider pursuing a Taxation certificate as an alternative.\n",

      "The link between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence and other criminal behavior is well-known and understood, and can provide a mechanism by which the cycle of violence can be broken. Further, the legal standing of animals and lack of consistent definitions and laws can be a significant impediment in the successful investigation of an animal cruelty case. The graduate certificate in Animal Cruelty Investigation is designed for individuals who wish to learn and apply the principles of investigation and forensic science to animal cruelty. This certificate is designed for an external audience. Current students should consult their academic advisor regarding its suitability to their program.  \n",
      "Students in this certificate will undertake courses in the link between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence, animal cruelty investigations and the application of forensic science to these investigations. Finally, the student undertakes a capstone Independent Study in an approved topic related to animal cruelty. All four courses are taken online and in four sequential accelerated terms.\n",

      "This certificate program provides a practical, \"hands-on\" approach to computer applications in molecular biology and focuses on the major issues concerning representation and analysis of biological sequence and structural information. With a strong foundation in computer science and molecular biology, students will acquire a background in generating, analyzing, and interpreting biological data, as well as the ability to apply such knowledge in biotechnology and medicine. The curriculum is designed to accommodate two convergent audiences: 1) molecular biology students with limited experience in computer systems who wish to upgrade their skills and knowledge in the field of bioinformatics, and 2) computer science students with computational or mathematical skills who wish to learn how to apply those skills to real biological problems.\n",
      "The curriculum for this certificate includes five courses (15 credits), which combine computer science, molecular genetics, and bioinformatics. Prerequisites for the certificate include undergraduate molecular biology or biochemistry and college algebra.\n",

      "The certificate in business intelligence is designed to provide students with the practical skills and theoretical knowledge essential for modern-day firms' increasing reliance on business intelligence. Business intelligence as a discipline consists of a variety of business processes for data, information and knowledge management, and a wide range of analytical tools for performing analyses of qualitative and quantitative data. The ultimate goal is to deploy data-driven, evidence-based thinking in the service of strategic and tactical business decisions. Numerous companies, especially those engaged in global markets - routinely leverage data to optimize operations and for strategic decision making.\n",
      "Companies understand that the efficient use of the data available within and outside of an enterprise can be the single most important reason for its success. Government agencies have also increasingly adopted business intelligence practices to more efficiently discharge their regulatory and administrative functions. Graduates will be positioned for any number of jobs including: business intelligence developers, knowledge managers, strategic analysts, solution designers, managers, administrators, data warehouse managers, and forecasting and planning analysts. Four courses (12 credits) are required.\n",

      "The online graduate certificate in Forensic Investigative Genetic Genealogy (FIGG) provides individuals in either the public or private sector with the foundational concepts and application of both genetic genealogy and traditional genealogy to forensic investigations. This can include but is not limited to criminal, civil, and family history investigations. The fundamentals of forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis will be included to provide the student with the principles, applications, and interpretation of biological evidence as it relates to forensic investigations. The principles of genetic genealogy will be explored to provide an understanding of the various DNA testing methods available for use in genetic genealogy investigations. Genealogical Research methods in the form of documentary evidence will provide the student with a strong foundation in the Genealogy Standards used in genealogical research to obtain valid results. Investigation techniques and ethical concepts will be included throughout the certificate program. The certificate program will culminate in the student undertaking a FIGG practicum through the completion of a full mock FIGG case. All courses are online and offered in 4 sequential mini-terms (i.e., 7 weeks).\n",

The certificate in Nutritional Genomics provides the detailed understanding of the principles of nutritional genomics, such as how individual genetic variation can influence the assimilation and metabolism of nutrition and how nutrition can affect the expression of certain genes known to be involved in chronic diseases. It will introduce clinical genomic research tools and methods (gene expression profiling, proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics), which prepare students to study an individual's response to their nutritional environment. It will also introduce individualized nutritional strategies to prevent chronic diseases and to optimize human health.\n",

      "Systems engineering has existed for many decades but was mostly used and appreciated by practitioners in the defense industry and companies working on military contracts.  The discipline, however, has gained popularity and acceptance by engineers and technologists in non-defense sectors because it helps them navigate effectively the intricacies associated with complex systems.  This 12-credit hour certificate is designed for professionals who wish to learn about and explore the concept of systems thinking, and acquire knowledge and expertise in the theory, applications, and approaches of systems engineering as applied to projects and products design and development.\n",
      "The required certificate courses also apply toward the requirements of the master of science in industrial engineering.  Candidates for the certificate are expected to have the requisite background in computing, probability, and statistics.  The program advisor, depending on the background of the candidate, may allow substitutions to best meet the professional need of the candidate.\n",

      "Graduates will be fully familiar with systems thinking and its advantages as they relate to both personal life and professional practice.\n",
      "Graduates will have a reservoir of knowledge, skills, and abilities to enable them to efficiently and effectively develop and apply any level of expertise in systems engineering and model-based systems engineering methodologies needed on their future projects.\n",
      "Graduates will be able to become effectively involved in service and/or leadership of the systems engineering profession and society at local, national, and global levels.\n",

      "The University of New Haven has always encouraged interdisciplinary studies. To foster a broader expertise in the areas of business administration and industrial engineering, a student can earn degrees in both fields by successfully completing the dual degree program.\n",
      "The program is intended for students with undergraduate engineering or technical degrees from programs accredited by ABET Inc., or demonstrated equivalent. Students entering this program are expected to be competent in mathematics through calculus. Those with insufficient mathematics background are required to take approved mathematics courses (e.g., MATH 6610  - Fundamentals of Calculus) outside/in addition to the program requirements.\n",
      "Applicants with degrees in fields other than industrial engineering are required to take a number of undergraduate courses, or otherwise demonstrate proficiency in areas normally included in an undergraduate industrial engineering program.\n",
      "Applicants are required to meet the requirements outlined in the admissions policy sections of each relevant degree program.\n",
      "\n",
      "The M.B.A./M.S.I.E. program consists of 71.5 credits. Up to 10.5 of these credits may be waived on the basis of undergraduate course work, leaving a minimum requirement of 61 credits. Any waivers of course work from the M.B.A. side of the curriculum must meet the waiver guidelines of the M.B.A. program. Waivers must be approved in writing by the appropriate department and are contingent upon subsequent academic performance. Graduate credit may be transferred from other accredited institutions subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog.\n",
      " \n",
      "Project/Thesis Requirement\n",
      "Students in the dual degree program must complete the business administration capstone course MGMT 6669  - Strategic Management. In addition, they must complete an industrial engineering special project or thesis within the elective portion of the program. The special project requirement may be satisfied by taking a project course in a group setting, when offered. A designated area of study may be indicated for each industrial engineering project course; the instructor will offer direction and assist students in the development of substantial individual projects. Particular requirements or prerequisites may be set for the course. With special approval, a student may take an individual research project courses or write a thesis (as listed in the catalog).\n",

In addition, they must complete an industrial engineering special project or thesis within the elective portion of the program. The special project requirement may be satisfied by taking a project course in a group setting, when offered. A designated area of study may be indicated for each industrial engineering project course; the instructor will offer direction and assist students in the development of substantial individual projects.

      "﻿ Feb 23, 2025 Engineering and Applied Science, Ph.D. The research-based Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Engineering and Applied Science prepares students for positions in academia, industry, or consulting in a specific engineering or applied science discipline with coursework and research tailored to the student's particular interests and professional goals. Students identify a field of research at the time of admission that aligns with their career goals, previous educational experience, and existing faculty expertise. Disciplines represented include biomedical engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, electrical engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechanical engineering. Specific specializations will necessarily depend on faculty research interests which, based upon current active research groups, may include such fields as biomaterials for medical devices, tissue engineering, rapid detection of microbes, cybersecurity and forensics, artificial intelligence, data science, nondestructive evaluation, radar signal processing, renewable energy systems, wireless communication and advanced antennas, structural engineering, sustainability in engineering, and environmental remediation. Coursework is likewise tailored to a student's research interest and prior academic background. Students entering directly into the Ph.D. program with a bachelor's degree will take at minimum 36 credits of coursework (12 courses: 3 Common, 9 Technical Core), of which 27 credits must be completed before taking the qualifying exam (3 semesters full-time). Students wanting a master's degree en passat must take an additional 15 credits of coursework (5 courses). All Ph.D. students shall be required to take three 3-credit, 7000-level Common Courses covering research methods and ethics, grant writing and management, and focused technical knowledge at a post-master's level. Students will also take nine 3-credit graduate-level Technical Core courses following an individualized program of study which is developed prior to admission and generally follows existing master's degree worksheets of various programs within the College of Engineering. Students will take the qualifying exam after their first (students entering with master's degrees) or third (students entering with bachelor's degrees) semester. These exams will be offered twice a year, before the start of the fall and spring semesters. The format of this exam will be decided by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee (containing members from each program represented in the Ph.D. program appointed by the Dean and chaired by the Ph.D. program coordinator) with input from the students' programs. Students will have at most two attempts. Students not passing the qualifying exam are dismissed from the Ph.D. program but should have completed the requirements for a master's degree. Students successfully passing the qualifying exam become Ph.D. candidates and are enrolled in Dissertation Research (3 credits each semester, counts as full-time enrollment). Students must complete a minimum of 15 credits of Dissertation Research (5 semesters). The final required component for graduation is the successful oral defense of a written dissertation of the student's original research. This will be adjudicated by a committee containing no fewer than four members, all of whom, including the major advisor, must hold a doctoral degree. The dissertation committee will include the primary research advisor (acting as chair), at least two University faculty members who have expertise in the field, and at least one additional member who is either external to the University or external to the College of Engineering. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. program, students will have individualized programs of study for the required coursework. Each applicant is required to find a primary advisor prior to admission. This advisor is the primary academic contact for the student and is responsible for creating an individualized plan of study. In general, this will be the primary research advisor for the student as well, although the student may change advisor under special circumstances. This advisor is expected to evaluate each student's progress in the program at least once per academic year, with written evaluations shared with the student. Admissions decisions are made by the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program Oversight Committee with the addition of the student's primary advisor. Students wishing to change advisors after matriculation will be required to meet with the current advisor, proposed advisor, and Ph.D. program coordinator, who will together make a decision in the best interests of the student. Standards for admission are as follows: • Successful completion of an MS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5; or successful completion of a BS degree in a related STEM area with a GPA of at least 3.5 • A strong statement of research aligned with the research expertise of one or more STEM-focused faculty at the University • Willingness of a STEM-focused faculty member in the University to supervise the candidate upon successful completion of the qualifying examination Goals of the Engineering and Applied Science Ph.D. Program include: 1. Preparing exceptional students for careers at academic institutions and industry 2. Offering students the knowledge and experiences required to respond to 21st century challenges across a broad field of specialties 3. Training students to conduct research and disseminate results in an ethical and professional manner 4. Providing a curriculum that develops critical and analytical thinking skills through an integrative approach of instruction, research, and evidence-based practices Upon completion of the Ph.D. in Engineering and Applied Science program, graduates will be able to: 1. Apply critical thinking skills in foundational areas of engineering and applied science. 2.

      "﻿ Feb 23, 2025 Coordinator: Christy D. Smith, Ph.D. The M.B.A./M.P.A. dual degree program is designed for those whose interests or career objectives are focused on both the public and private sectors of the economy. The program broadly stresses the use of management skills and analytic techniques applied to business, industrial, governmental, and not-for-profit organizations. The M.B.A./M.P.A. program consists of 68.5 credits. Up to 7.5 credits may be waived on the basis of undergraduate course work or work in public administration settings, leaving a minimum requirement of 61 credits. Waivers must be approved in writing by the appropriate department and are conditional upon subsequent academic performance. Graduate credit may be transferred from other accredited institutions subject to the graduate policy on transfer credit detailed elsewhere in this catalog. Project/Thesis Requirement Students choose one of two alternatives for completion of the final six credits of course work in the M.B.A./M.P.A. dual degree curriculum. Most students take the two capstone/research project courses PADM 6690 - Research Seminar and MGMT 6669 - Strategic Management . Alternatively, students may elect to take the two-course, six-credit thesis option (Thesis I and II). If the thesis option is selected, the thesis must show ability to organize material in a clear and original manner and to present well-reasoned conclusions. Thesis preparation and submission must comply with the graduate policy on theses as well as specific department requirements. Note: Thesis I and II are not permitted as substitutions for MGMT 6669. If the thesis option is selected, MGMT 6669 must still be completed as the capstone course for the M.B.A. program .
