 Feb 28, 2025 Construction Engineering and Management, M.S. STEM Designation: This program is STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math)-designated by the Department of Homeland Security. For more information, please see https://www.newhaven.edu/admissions/stem-designated-programs.php The MS in Construction Engineering and Management is a 30-credit hour program. This program aims to prepare students to work on construction projects as a construction project manager. It will equip students with fundamental knowledge and software skills in Building Information Modeling (BIM), construction engineering and management, estimating, and planning. Students will study construction law and regulations and risk management and be exposed to construction safety and inspection standards. In addition, this program will also provide students with advanced knowledge in sustainability and green buildings, urban planning, and highway engineering. Graduates of this program can pursue multiple career pathways, such as Construction Manager, Project Engineer, Project Manager, Project Controller, Construction Estimator, BIM Expert, Field (Construction) Inspector, and Researcher in academic institutions and government. Program Outcomes Upon completion of the program, graduates will be able to: Apply various construction engineering principles and management techniques to efficiently plan and monitor construction projects. Analyze the business aspects of construction. Utilize software for construction planning and estimating while adhering to relevant engineering specifications and industry best practices. Communicate effective techniques for construction engineering and management.
